This policy sets forth a framework governing the assignment of responsibility to individuals throughout the university. It is designed to provide the appropriate oversight, accountability, and transparency to ensure that commitments of university resources are executed appropriately and in accord with applicable laws, regulations and university policies. \nAccordingly, this Guide Memo contains policies governing signature and financial approval authority for execution of both financial and non-financial agreements on behalf of the university. \nThis policy applies to all university operations and projects, irrespective of physical location, except SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford Health Care and Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, and their subsidiaries and controlled entities, which are subject to their own policies.\n1. Key Definitions\na. Signature Authority/Authority to Enter into an Agreement on behalf of the University\nSignature authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to sign or otherwise enter into an agreement on behalf of the University.\nDelegated signature authority is required to sign or enter into agreements (which are inclusive of any form of written or oral contracts that create any legal obligations for the university, as further described below) or otherwise bind or obligate the university to a financial or a non-financial commitment. \nNote that signature authority for many types of agreements is reserved for specific university offices. See the Reserved Authority section for additional details.\nb. Financial Approval/PTA Authority\nFinancial approval/PTA authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to spend or approve the commitment of university funds within the scope of their management responsibility, such as a school, department or administrative unit. Generally, this type of authority is delegated within the university financial systems (as defined below) and pertains only to the approval of transactions within university financial systems. Financial approval authority does not include signature authority as described above or other reserved authority as described below. Additionally, sufficient financial approval authority is required for all transaction approvals, including projects that have already received budget approval. An individual may be delegated financial approval authority for a specific project or initiative by the President or Board of Trustees that is greater than their normal financial authority, for example with respect to a large capital project.\nAdministrative Guide Memo 3.2.1: Responsibility for University Funds further provides that expenditures must be: (1) reasonable and necessary; (2) consistent with established university policies and practices applicable to the work of the university, including instruction, research, and public service; and (3) consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.\nc. Exercise of Authority\nIndividuals entering into an agreement on behalf of the university must have signature authority that has been explicitly delegated from the Board of Trustees or via the sub-delegation process from the President.\nWhen an action is within one’s signature authority delegation, the delegate must exercise sound business judgment, including:\nConsultation and coordination with other officers, faculty, staff or other persons who may have overlapping responsibilities\nEnsuring compliance with all relevant university policies and external requirements\nVisit Fingate, the Gateway to Financial Activities website, to learn more about signature versus financial approval authority and a list of university contacts available to provide expert assistance.\n2. Scope of Signature and Approval Authority Delegated to the University President\nBy resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, the President has the general authority, on behalf of the university and its subsidiaries (excluding Stanford Health Care, Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital, and their subsidiaries and controlled entities), to execute agreements and other documents, and to approve and carry out transactions and other actions relating to all aspects of the operations of the university, except where powers are reserved to the Board of Trustees or other officers, divisions, or subsidiaries of the university by resolutions of the Board, the Board’s Bylaws, the Founding Grant, law, or otherwise. The delegation to the President includes, but is not limited to, the power to:\nNegotiate and execute agreements\nExecute other documents, including government and non-government documents\nSubmit applications and reports\nSettle disputes\nAccept gifts, grants and/or other funding\nExercise investment authority other than that which has been expressly delegated to Stanford Management Company (SMC)\nCreate, maintain, operate and/or dissolve subsidiaries or other related entities of the university\nEstablish, maintain and manage bank investment and brokerage accounts and the associated funds\nAdditionally, all financial commitments (as defined below) exceeding $25 million require the approval of the Board, unless the commitment is:\nFor ordinary and necessary expenses that are required for the day-to-day operations of the university, such as wages, employee benefits, utilities, communication and data charges, insurance premiums, food services and the like\nRequired to comply with tax or other government (domestic and foreign) regulations (e.g. payments for taxes, social security, unemployment, disability insurance, etc.)\nProvided under the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) Management and Operating (M&O) contract with the Department of Energy\nProvided under investment agreements managed by Stanford Management Company (SMC) \nConstruction, renovation or building improvement projects require the approval of the Board, unless obtaining an approval may conflict with rights that have been granted under an existing agreement, if the project is on or within university-owned land, and:\nHas a financial commitment in excess of $25 million (unless the commitment is otherwise provided under SLAC’s M&O contract or under investment authority otherwise granted to SMC),\nIs for creation of new development on a previously undeveloped site, or\nWill result in the change in use of an existing site\n3. Delegation from University President to University Officers, Deans and Directors\nThe President may delegate signature and financial approval authority to each Officer, Dean, and Director reporting to the President (AGM 9.1.1: President and Officers Reporting to the President) or Provost (AGM 9.2.1: Provost and Officers Reporting to the Provost). Individual officers’ specific scope of responsibility and limits of specific reserved delegations are documented, retained and available for review in the Signature Authority Delegation Letter Repository on the Fingate website. The dollar limit to this authority, to the extent that it relates to financial approval authority, is documented in the university’s Authority Manager System. \nFinancial commitments (as defined in the Definitions section) that are reasonably expected to accumulate, over the course of the current or ensuing fiscal year(s), to a level in excess of an individual’s delegated signature authority must be treated as being outside of the limits of delegated authority. Such financial commitments must be approved by a delegate with the appropriate level of authority, if any, or by the Board of Trustees.\n4. Sub-Delegations\nWithin the scope of authority documented above for each Officer, Dean and Director reporting to the President or Provost, that individual may further sub-delegate signature and/or financial approval authority within their line of reporting, unless specifically prohibited. Such sub-delegations must also be documented, retained and available for review in the Signature Authority Delegation Letter Repository on the Fingate website.\nSignature authority sub-delegations should be limited, to the extent possible, to the next level of direct reports. All additional financial approval authority sub-delegations must be documented and maintained in the university Authority Manager system. Sub-delegations must be commensurate with the responsibilities of the sub-delegate. For example, it is generally not appropriate to sub-delegate more than half of one’s financial approval authority to another individual. \nSub-delegation of authority does not equate to delegation of responsibility. It remains the responsibility of the person granting the authority to exercise appropriate oversight to ensure that sub-delegates exercise their sub-delegation with care and responsibility.\n5. Documentation\nDocumentation of all delegations and sub-delegations is retained and available online for review by anyone with a Stanford University ID (SUNet ID). To learn how to access the repository and how to request updates to delegation letters, see Signature Authority Delegation Letter Repository on the Fingate website.\n6. Reserved Authority\nRegardless of the scope of an individual’s delegated authority, execution of certain types of transactions and agreements is reserved for specific offices within the university, as further described in the applicable policies referenced below. \na. Accepting Gifts on Behalf of the University\nIn general, only Office of Development (OOD) may accept gifts (e.g., cash, property, charitable gift trusts or other types of assets) on behalf of the university. In limited circumstances, individual departments (e.g., libraries and museums) are authorized to accept certain types of gifts (e.g., books, archival materials, and arts). OOD should be consulted in the gift solicitation and acceptance process as stated in AGM 4.2.1: Receiving and Processing Gifts.\nb. Construction or Remodeling\nConstruction of new buildings or remodeling involving a major exterior design change is managed through Lands, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE). Within policy, LBRE may grant approval for Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP), facility and infrastructure projects that are managed by staff within individual schools and departments; see the Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP) policy.\nc. Employment Policies\nThe Provost, for faculty and academic staff appointments, and the Vice President for University Human Resources, for regular staff and contingent positions, have responsibility for establishment of employment policies.\nd. Investments\nStanford Management Company (SMC) has signature authority for its management of the Merged Pool and the Intermediate Pool, and any other investments that it manages or administers. Signature authority related to the School & Department Investment funds is documented in individual delegation letters for the applicable School/VP Area. SMC reserves the authority to direct other pools of investment capital not managed by SMC as needed to avoid conflicts with the Merged Pool and the Intermediate Pool.\ne. Purchasing\nUniversity Procurement, within Financial Management Services, has responsibility for purchasing, placing orders and executing contracts for goods and services for the university, subject to the receipt of an approved Purchase Requisition. Procurement is the sole holder of this authority at the university, with the exception of sub-delegations that have been granted by the University President or otherwise approved by the Vice President for Business Affairs & CFO. Procurement maintains the list of exceptions as stated in AGM 5.1.1: Procurement Policies.\nIndividuals with sufficient financial approval authority may make purchases of commercially available off-the-shelf items and related services of $25,000 or less as long as the purchase does not require a signed agreement. These purchases must be reasonable and necessary, consistent with established university policies and practices applicable to the work of the university, including instruction, research, and public service, and must be consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.\nIntra-university service agreements, such as requests to university service centers for catering, maintenance or telecommunication services, are outside the purview of University Procurement and may be signed and negotiated by the applicable office and academic unit, as long as the transaction is routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA Authority.\nf. Financial Accounts and Debt Issuance\nOpening, maintaining and closing bank accounts is restricted to authorized staff members within the Office of the Treasurer (OoT). Additionally, OoT has responsibility for debt issuance. See AGM 3.6.1: Bank Accounts.\ng. Related Entities\nThe authority to create, acquire, dispose of or terminate legal entities is reserved to the Office of General Counsel and the Vice President of Business Affairs & CFO, except as otherwise provided in the applicable policy. See AGM 3.7.1: Establishment and Governance of Legal Entities.\nh. Research-Related Agreements\nThe authority to sign research-related agreements for sponsored grants, contracts, awards, and sub-awards is reserved to the Office of Research Administration (ORA), the Office of Technology Licensing (OTL), the Industrial Contracts Office, and the School of Medicine Research Management Group (RMG).\n7. Related Entities and Subsidiaries\nWith respect to the reserved authorities detailed above, if local laws, the subsidiary’s corporate governance arrangements, or the university’s internal policies require the signature authority or financial authority to rest with the authorized representative(s) for the subsidiary, the subsidiary and the relevant offices should determine the appropriate process to review, manage and sign agreements for such reserved authorities. Otherwise, if specified in a delegation, an individual’s signature and financial authority may extend to such subsidiaries.\n8. Definitions\na. Agreement\nAn agreement is defined as any written or oral contract between the university (which includes any of its business units or related entities) and a third party that creates any legal obligation for the university. Agreements could include, but are not limited to:\nAgreements that create any financial commitment, including the potential for a financial commitment, for the university, regardless of funding source, such as purchase orders or property leases\nAgreements that set terms for acceptance of gifts and grants\nBusiness Associate Addendum\nClick-through Agreement\nCollaborative Research Agreement\nCorporate formation and maintenance documents for legal entities\nData Use Agreements\nLetters of Intent\nLicensing Agreements\nMaterial Transfer Agreements\nMemoranda of Understanding (if it contains any binding obligations)\nNon-disclosure or confidential disclosure agreements\nPermission to use the university’s name\nScope of Work/Proposal\nSoftware or Software as a Service (SaaS) Licensing Agreement\nb.

University Financial Systems\nSystems maintained by the university for the purposes of facilitating and recording financial transactions.\n9. Special Situations\na. Internal Transfer of Expense\nInternal transfer of expense, from one PTA to another, is not subject to this policy as long as the original approval of the expense was consistent with the policy documented above. However, the journal transaction must be routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA Authority. Reference Administrative Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers for details.\nb. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDAs)\nThe principle of openness in research, as stated in Research Policy Handbook 1.4: Openness in Research, sets forth freedom of access by all interested persons to the underlying data, processes, and final results of research, is of overriding importance at Stanford University. Because the university’s “open” environment is not conducive to maintaining confidentiality, generally, the university does not sign NDAs.\nPrincipal Investigators, researchers, or others (collectively “Recipients”) may wish to accept confidential information, materials, or technology from a third-party sponsor or supplier that requires execution of a NDA. Recipients cannot sign on behalf of the university. However, Recipients may individually take responsibility for the acceptance and protection of the information, materials or technology being shared.\nStandard NDA templates are available from Office of Technology Licensing (OTL) and Office of General Counsel (OGC).\nIf the sponsor or supplier agrees to use the university’s template without modifications, recipients may sign it with no further review.\nRecipients should be aware that sponsor or supplier requested terms in NDAs may violate university policy. Therefore, if the sponsor or supplier presents their own template or requests modifications to the university’s template, Recipients should consult with OSR, OTL, the Research Management Group (RMG), the Procurement Services Contracts Office or OGC prior to signing.\nc. Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOIs)\nWhile generally discouraged, in rare circumstances an MOU or LOI may be needed to advance a new relationship in anticipation of future formal agreements. \nSee the Research Policy Handbook (RPH) for the full policy statement for such agreements, including a link to a standard MOU template.\nd. Click-through Agreements\n“Click-through” agreements are generally used in online transactions, such as purchasing of online services or licensing of software product, where a user is required to agree to terms prior to using the product or service. Click-through agreements can be legally binding and therefore are subject to this policy. \nIf the click-through agreement creates binding obligations on the University, please review the terms before you click “accept” to ensure that the agreement does not contain terms that violate university policies. Examples of problematic terms include:\nTerms that involve use, license or transfer of the university’s name, logo, trademark, patents, copyright, and/or other intellectual property, including for marketing or other promotional purposes \nTerms that may violate the university’s policies on openness in research\nTerms that may commit the university to binding obligations that are beyond the scope of the user’s delegated authority\nTerms that may conflict with the university’s privacy and security policies and guidelines. For example, click-through agreements should generally not be used for services involving the storage, receipt, processing or publishing of moderate risk or high risk data (e.g. unpublished research data, student records, protected health information, other personally-identifiable information) unless the service providers are reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines.\nPlease consult with Procurement if you require assistance with a click-through agreement that may bind the university. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the university will not be bound to any click-through term or condition that conflicts with this policy or other university policies and guidelines. Also, please visit Essential Stanford Software or Software at Stanford for information on software available to use or purchase."}

Stanford Policy\nStanford University is committed to increasing significantly the opportunities for minority, women and disabled people to engage in business with the University.\na. Purpose\nThis policy statement supports a long-range plan to enhance Stanford's external affirmative action. The plan serves to promote diversity through the judicious use of the University's financial and other resources to increase opportunities for small businesses and businesses owned by targeted concerns to participate in economic opportunities arising from University business activities.\nb. Scope\nThe classes covered by this policy, as defined by the Federal Government, include Asian, Black, Latino/Hispanic and Native American, women of all racial/ethnic background, people who are disabled or physically challenged, veterans, and other targeted concerns.\nc. Implementation\nThe President and Provost will provide the leadership for promulgating this policy; however, responsibility for its implementation rests with individual vice presidents, deans, directors of major institutions and centers, the Chief Executive Officer of the Stanford Management Company, and the heads of other organizations not covered above.\n2. Federal Contracts\nPublic Law 95-507 and Executive Order 12138 encourage organizations that receive contracts from federal agencies to do business with small businesses and other targeted concerns regardless of size. The University's responsibilities under these laws are described in detail in the document \"Utilization of Small Business Concerns, Small Business Concerns Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, and Women-Owned Business Concerns,\" which is published in the Procurement Manual. Specific questions as to applicability to particular situations should be addressed to the Office of Sponsored Research.\na. Definitions\n\"Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities. The social disadvantage of individuals must stem from circumstances beyond their control.\" 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(3)(i)\n\"Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities, as compared to others in the same line of business and competitive market area who are not socially disadvantaged.\" 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(4)(i)\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) defines the members of these groups. An updated listing can be found online at the U.S. Small Business Administration website. \nSubcontract: \"Any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract.\" Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 80-2.Under this definition, subcontracting means every purchase order and agreement, as well as other expenses such as travel.\nb. Contracts Affected\n(1) Contracts between $25,000 and $499,999\nTerms of government contracts over $25,000 in value require the University to have a program to insure business opportunities for small and minority owned businesses. Stanford's External Affirmative Action Program meets that requirement.\n(2) Contracts $500,000 and over\nFor contracts of $500,000 or more, a specific plan must be made and implemented. A Small Business Liaison Officer (a Stanford-designated University official) oversees the operation of the plan. The University is responsible for establishing percentage goals of subcontracting business (expressed as a proportion of total subcontracting dollars) to be awarded to small and small disadvantaged suppliers. For assistance or information on goals required by specific agencies, contact the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR).\nc. Procedures\n(1) Preparing the Subcontracting Plan\nWhen a request for a subcontracting plan is received from an agency, OSR notifies the cognizant department and Procurement. Procurement and the department meet to review product and service areas with subcontracting opportunities, and based on this review, determine reasonable goals for the plan. Procurement submits data for the plan to OSR. Procurement then writes the subcontracting plan and submits it to the government agency.\n(2) Vendor Search\nDepartments must investigate small and disadvantaged business possibilities prior to submitting a requisition. Departments that wish further searching to be done by Procurement should so specify in the \"Remarks\" screen of the requisition, and should attach documentation of the department's search efforts and their results.\n(3) Reports\nThe federal government requires periodic reports on progress toward the achievement of goals set in a contract's original subcontracting plan. Procurement prepares reports of purchases under each contract, and notifies departments of progress against goals.\n3. Sources of Business Information\na. Directories\nTo help departments, Procurement maintains small business directories and other resources. All the directories are commodity-indexed. Call Procurement for copies and information.\nb. Online Access to Supplier Information\nOnline information about vendor size, ownership status and products offered is available to departments in the Oracle Financials system.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/computing/digital-accessibility/accessibility-electronic-content","text":"6.8.1 Accessibility of Electronic Content\nThis policy addresses the responsibilities and processes for Stanford’s electronic content and accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Stanford is committed to making its electronic content accessible to its students, faculty, staff, and all other individuals with disabilities participating or engaging in the programs and activities of the University.\nApplicability: This policy is applicable to all Stanford University academic, administrative, and research units that develop, use, maintain, or procure electronic content used in conducting University business.\nPolicy Statement: Stanford University electronic content is to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, Level A and Level AA standard. Where conformance with this standard is not technically feasible or would result in a fundamental alteration of the nature of the services provided through the electronic content, the University will engage with the individual to provide an equally effective alternative.\n1. Definitions\nAccessible\nWhen an individual with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.\nEqually Effective\nAlternative access to electronic content that, while not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement, affords an individual with a disability equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual’s needs.\nIndividual with a disability\nAn individual who has one or more physical or mental impairments that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\nElectronic Content\nElectronic information and data, as well as the encoding that defines its structure, presentation, and interactions, that accesses, displays, or transmits University or student information within the Stanford University domain or are used in the programs or activities of the University. Examples include, but are not limited to: websites; web- and mobile-based applications; audio and video media; and electronic documents.\nTimely\nAs it relates to equally effective alternative access to electronic content, timely means that the individual with a disability receives access to electronic content in reasonable time frame that meets the needs of the individual based on the circumstances.\nUsers\nDefined as current and prospective Stanford students, applicants for admission, Stanford staff and faculty, and other participants in the University's programs and activities.\nWCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA\nThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0, Level A and Level AA (“WCAG 2.0 A/AA”) are technical standards for web content accessibility developed by the World Wide Web Consortium.\n2. Responsibilities\nOversight of this policy is delegated to the head of a specific subdivision of the University governance structure (“department”), such as a Dean, Department Chair, Administrative Department head, Vice President, Vice Provost, or Principal Investigator (“lead”). This individual is responsible for compliance with all University policies relating to the accessibility of electronic content owned, used, or otherwise residing in their department.\nThe lead may designate another University employee either internal or external to the department to manage and address the accessibility of electronic content residing in said department.\nThe designated person will:\nTake appropriate actions to uphold the accessibility of electronic content.\nCommunicate this policy, and other applicable accessibility information and practices to electronic content users.\nCooperate with the Office of Digital Accessibility to respond to and resolve accessibility issues resulting from the development, use, maintenance, or purchase of the electronic content under their control.\n3. Implementation\nStanford University personnel responsible for existing electronic content, subject to the requirements and exceptions of the applicable laws, are to bring those resources into conformance with the WCAG Level 2.0, Level A and Level AA standard.\nNew electronic content under development and purchase, including any development and purchases for major revisions or updates of existing resources, are to conform to WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA.\nFor electronic content in which conformance with the WCAG 2.0, Level A and Level AA standard is not technically feasible or would result in a fundamental alteration of the nature of the services provided through the electronic content, the University will provide an equally effective alternative.\nUniversity websites are to contain a mechanism for users to report accessibility barriers to a designated person, with notification to the Office of Digital Accessibility. This may include an accessible online form, email, or other contact information to report the accessibility barrier. The recommended location for this information is on the website's \"Accessibility\" page, and to provide a link to that page in the header or footer that persists on every page.\n4. Temporary Exception Process\nA temporary exception to this policy may be requested through the Office of Digital Accessibility. Exception requests must include a detailed description as to why conformance with the Policy is not technically feasible or would result in a fundamental alteration of the nature of the services provided through the electronic content. An exception request granted for specified electronic content is for a limited duration and will be reviewed on a periodic basis.\n5. Implementation Assistance\nTechniques for achieving accessibility, technical guidance, and best practices for electronic content are available from the Office of Digital Accessibility. Such assistance may include, but is not limited to, website scanning and monitoring, manual code review, user testing with assistive technologies, accessibility tools and procedures for evaluating websites and web-based applications, accessibility solutions for mobile applications, and training and best practices for electronic content accessibility.\n6. Responding to Accessibility Issues\nAddressing the accessibility of electronic content is an ongoing process. Upon being notified of an accessibility issue with electronic content, a University employee must promptly:\nAcknowledge the receipt of the issue in writing to the User reporting the issue, with a copy to the Office of Digital Accessibility that identifies the date and the reported accessibility issue.\nConsult with the Office of Digital Accessibility to determine appropriate next steps. These steps may include the following: \nRecommendation of a resolution to the reported accessibility issue.\nDetermination of a reasonable timeline for resolution and, if appropriate, respond to the User reporting the issue of that expected timeline.\nCommunication with the User reporting the issue to determine if an alternate access solution is necessary while the accessibility issue is resolved.\nCommunication with the User reporting the issue with information as to the status of the accessibility issue if the resolution timeline is modified or changed.\nUpon resolution of the issue, if appropriate, communicate the status to the User reporting the issue and verify their ability to access the electronic content.\nIf the Office of Digital Accessibility, in consultation with the University representative responsible for the electronic content, determines that the electronic content cannot be made accessible, or that doing so would constitute a fundamental alteration of the nature of the services provided through the electronic content, the Office of Accessible Education (for academic-related issues) or Diversity and Access Office (for non-academic-related issues) will engage in an interactive process with the User about alternative methods for providing the information or service in an equally effective alternative manner.\nIn the event that an equally effective alternative manner cannot be provided or the User is not satisfied with the results, they may contact the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer at the Diversity and Access Office by telephone at (650) 723-0755 or by email at disability.access@stanford.edu for assistance in resolving the issue.\n7. Cognizant Office\nThe Office of Digital Accessibility, or other person designated by the President, shall be the primary contact for the interpretation, monitoring, and implementation of this policy.\n8.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/student-employment-and-assistantships/sick-time-student-hourly-employees/sick-time-student","text":"10.3.1 Sick Time for Student Hourly Employees\nThis Guide Memo summarizes paid sick time accrual and usage policies for Stanford student hourly employees.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all Stanford undergraduate student employees as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 10.1.1: Undergraduate Student Employment on Campus and Stanford graduate student hourly employees as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.2: Graduate Student Hourly Employment. This policy is effective starting on July 1, 2015.\n1. Sick Time Benefits\nSick time provides a mechanism to pay student hourly employees when they are unable to perform their scheduled work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons as detailed below. All Stanford “student hourly employees” (as defined in section 2. Definitions, below) receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee’s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours.\n2. Definitions\nAll Stanford undergraduate and graduate students who are hired on an hourly basis are referred to as “student hourly employees” in this policy. This Administrative Guide Memo applies to Stanford students hired on an hourly basis as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 10.1.1: Undergraduate Student Employment on Campus and Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.2: Graduate Student Hourly Employment. Graduate students hired in an assistantship appointment (see Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships) and Postdoctoral Fellows and Postdoctoral Research Affiliates (see Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions) are not student hourly employees.\n3. Accrual and Recording of Sick Time\na. Accrual of Sick Time\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time as follows:\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time at the rate of .03334 hours per hour worked. This equates to one (1) hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year-to-year, with a maximum limit of 80 hours or ten (10) days.\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time for all hourly jobs worked at Stanford, regardless of the department of employment. When a student hourly employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the University, the student hourly employee’s sick time balance is maintained as long as the new position starts within 12 months of the date of termination from the first position. If the new position is not a student hourly employee position, the student hourly employee is subject to any sick time policies applicable to the new position, including, without limitation, any policies regarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals.\nb. Recording Sick Time Accrual\nA student hourly employee’s accrued sick time is recorded in Axess with the sick time balance reported on the student hourly employee’s pay statement.\n4. Use of Sick Time\nSick time is paid only when used to replace scheduled work hours during the course of employment. Otherwise, sick time balances are not paid out.\nArrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee’s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments at a time outside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee’s work hours.\nStudent hourly employees are entitled to use accrued sick time beginning on the 90th calendar day after the start of employment. Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. The use of sick time is limited to 40 hours or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater, each year of employment. Sick time may only be used for an absence that a student hourly employee has during scheduled work hours.\nSick time is not paid out when a student hourly employee ends employment for any reason, including, without limitation, no longer being employed in a student hourly employee position, leaving the University for any reason, taking a leave of absence, or being in non-enrollment status.\nSick time may be used for the following reasons:\na. Absence Due to Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a student hourly employee’s illness or injury prevents the student hourly employee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments, including:\nDiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventive care\nThose appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking\nSick time may be used by a student hourly employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking in order to:\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or welfare of the victim or their child\nSeek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nObtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nObtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nParticipate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation\nd. Family Sick Time\nStudent hourly employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a student hourly employee’s family member. For the purpose of this policy, a family member includes the student hourly employee’s:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the student hourly employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the student hourly employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child’s age or dependency status)\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a student hourly employee or the student hourly employee’s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the student hourly employee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\nOther family member dependent on the student hourly employee and living in the student hourly employee's household\n5. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe student hourly employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how student hourly employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the student hourly employee should provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the student hourly employee should provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. If a student hourly employee requests to use accrued sick time and the student hourly employee’s use of sick time is within applicable limits per year of employment, the request should not be denied because details are not provided about the sick time use.\nTo the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments at a time outside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee’s work hours.\nb. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical confirmation related to use of sick time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a student hourly employee's use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a student hourly employee's failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met.\n(2) Medical confirmation related to possible abuse or misuse of sick time\nIf the University has reasonable basis to believe that a student hourly employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a student hourly employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (i.e., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable medical evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner’s statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when the student hourly employee is released to return to work.\nc. Reporting Sick Time Use\nStudent hourly employees record hours of sick time used in the Axess Timecard each pay period. Student hourly employees may only be paid for the number of sick time hours that they have accrued and which is available to them. The use of sick time is limited to 40 hours or five scheduled work days each year of employment, whichever is greater. Up to 40 hours of sick time use may be recorded in Axess; if a student hourly employee has five scheduled work days of sick time use that exceeds 40 hours, the student hourly employee should request assistance from the local Human Resources office. Student hourly employees are not paid for time spent away from work in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment, and such time is not recorded in Axess. For information about Axess see this Time & Leave System overview.\nd. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time must be accrued before it can be used. Sick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service, calculated based upon work hours recorded during the previous month. If a student hourly employee needs to use sick time that has been accrued but not yet credited in Axess, the student hourly employee should speak to the local Human Resources office for assistance.\ne. Tax Status\nIncome that the student hourly employee receives for sick time is taxable. Applicable taxes are deducted.\nf. Multiple Forms of Employment\nStudent hourly employees who are employed by Stanford in other ways are affected as follows:\nAssistantships: Graduate students who have assistantship appointments, either concurrently or at different times of the year, will see a separate accounting of sick time accrued for the assistantship appointment. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships)\nTemporary or casual employment: Students who are hired as temporary or casual employees in the same 12 month period in which they were student hourly employees will have previously accrued sick time, up to the applicable limits, available for use. Temporary or casual employment for students typically occurs in summer, following graduation, or when a student is on a leave of absence\nScholarship, fellowship, and stipend support: Students who receive stipend support for a scholarship, fellowship, or other reasons, are not Stanford employees and do not receive a sick time benefit\ng. Sources of Funds for Sick Time\nAs sick time is used to replace scheduled work time, it should be recorded in Axess on the timecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is charged to the department that owns this job record. Departments employing a student on Federal Work Study must provide their own unrestricted funding to pay for sick time when used. This unrestricted PTA should be recorded on the timecard as sick time is used.\nh. Applicable Laws\nThe intent of this Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1 is to meet or exceed requirements of all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522 and Senate Bill 616."}

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/university-code-conduct/university-code-conduct","text":"1.1.1 University Code of Conduct\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 1\nThis Guide Memo defines the University's Code of Conduct.\nApplicability:\nThe Code applies to these groups of people, referred to as members of the Stanford University Community:\nFaculty, staff, students and postdoctoral scholars of Stanford University;\nMembers of the Board of Trustees;\nConsultants, contractors and others, when performing services for the University or interacting with members of the University Community, acting on behalf of the University, or otherwise required under contract to comply with this Code; and\nIndividuals who perform services for the University as volunteers.\n1. Introduction and Purpose\na. Introduction\nAll members of the University Community are responsible for sustaining the high ethical standards of this institution, and of the broader community in which we function. The University values integrity, diversity, respect, freedom of inquiry and expression, trust, honesty and fairness and strives to integrate these values into its education, research, health care and business practices.\nb. Purpose\nIn that spirit, this Code is a shared statement of our commitment to upholding the ethical, professional and legal standards we use as the basis for our daily and long-term decisions and actions. We all must be aware of and comply with the relevant policies, standards, laws and regulations that guide our work. We are each individually accountable for our own actions and, as members of the University Community, are collectively accountable for upholding these standards of behavior and for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and policies.\n2. Standards of Integrity and Quality\nStanford recognizes that it must earn and maintain a reputation for integrity that includes, but is not limited to, compliance with laws and regulations and its contractual obligations. Even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can be damaging to the University. Stanford must strive at all times to maintain the highest standards of integrity and quality.\nThere are times when Stanford's business activities and other conduct of its University Community members are not governed by specific laws or regulations. In these instances, rules of fairness, honesty, and respect for the rights of others will govern our conduct at all times.\nIn addition, each individual is required to conduct University business transactions with the utmost honesty, accuracy and fairness. Each situation needs to be examined in accordance with this standard. No unethical practice can be tolerated, even if such practice is \"customary\" outside of Stanford or even if some of the goals it serves are worthy. Expediency should never compromise integrity.\n3. Respect for Others\nStanford University is an institution dedicated to the pursuit of excellence and facilitation of an environment that fosters this goal. Central to that institutional commitment is the principle of treating each University Community member fairly and with respect, and embracing diversity and inclusion. See Statement from the President and Provost on Advancing Free Speech and Inclusion.\nThe University prohibits discrimination and harassment and provides equal opportunities for all Community members and applicants regardless of their race, color, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, reproductive health decision-making, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, military status, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law. Where actions are found to have occurred that violate this standard the University will take prompt action to cease the offending conduct, prevent its recurrence and discipline those responsible. Find policies in support of this standard at these locations:\nGeneral Employment Policies\nFaculty Handbook 4.2 Statement on Academic Freedom\nPolicy on Sexual Harassment\nPolicy on Consensual Sexual or Romantic Relationships in the Workplace and Educational Setting\nPolicies on Prohibited Sexual Conduct: Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Assault, Stalking Relationship Violence, Violation of University Court Directives, Student-on-Student Sexual Harassment and Retaliation\nPolicy on Equal Employment Opportunity, Non-Discrimination, and Affirmative Action\nPolicy for Protection of Minors\nProtected Identity Harm Reporting\nDiversity & Access Office\nSexual Harassment Policy Office\n4. Compliance with Laws and Applicable Policies and Procedures\nMembers of the Stanford University Community must transact University business in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and University policy and procedure. Managers and supervisors are responsible for teaching and monitoring compliance. When questions arise pertaining to interpretation or applicability of policy, contact the individual who has oversight of the policy. Refer all unresolved questions and/or interpretation of laws and regulations to the Office of the General Counsel. University-wide policy documents can be found at policy.stanford.edu.\na. Contractual, Grant and Other Obligations\nThe acceptance of an agreement, including sponsored project funding, may create a legal obligation on the part of Stanford University to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement and applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, only individuals who have authority delegated by an appropriate University official may enter into agreements on behalf of the University. See Administrative Guide Memo 5.1.1 Procurement Policies.\nb. Environmental Health & Safety, including Workplace Health and Safety\nMembers of the University Community must be committed to protecting the health and safety of its members by providing safe workplaces. The University will provide information and training about health and safety hazards, and safeguards. University Community members must adhere to good health and safety practices and comply with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations. See Stanford Health and Safety Training Policies.\nc. Non-University Professional Standards\nSome professions and disciplines represented at the University are governed by standards and codes specific to their profession (such as attorneys, certified public accountants, and medical doctors). Those professional standards generally advance the quality of the profession and/or discipline by developing codes of ethics, conduct, and professional responsibility and standards to guide their members. Those belonging to such organizations are expected to adhere to University policies and codes of conduct in addition to any professional standards. If a University Community member believes there is a conflict between a professional standard and University policy, they should contact the Office of the General Counsel.\nd. Academic Policies\nSee Academic Policies and Statements on the Stanford Bulletin website for academic policies.\n5. Confidentiality, Privacy and Information Security\nUniversity Community members receive and generate various types of confidential, regulated, proprietary and private information on behalf of the University. All members of the Community are expected to comply with all applicable rules, laws, and regulations (whether federal, state, local or foreign), contractual obligations, and University policies pertaining to the use, protection and disclosure of this information. When disaffiliating from Stanford, University Community members must return all sensitive University data unless an exception has been granted.\nFind office websites and supporting policies at the following locations:\nPrivacy Office\nInformation Security Office\nPolicy on Privacy and Access to Electronic Information\nPolicy on Information Security\nPolicy on Information Security Incident Response\nPolicy on Privacy and Security of Health Information (HIPAA)\nPolicy on Computer and Network Usage\nUniversity Policies and Statements (for Students)\n6. Financial Responsibilities and Internal Controls\nMembers of the University Community are expected to employ sound business practices and exercise prudent financial management in their stewardship of University resources. Refer to Section 3 of the Administrative Guide for responsibilities related to protection and management of University financial assets.\nPolicies on Financial Administration\n7. Use of University Resources\nUniversity resources must be reserved for business purposes on behalf of the University. They may not be used for personal gain, and may not be used for personal use except in a manner that is incidental, and reasonable in light of the employee's duties. University resources include, but are not limited to:\nUniversity systems (e.g., telephone systems, data communication and networking services),\nThe Stanford domain for electronic communication forums,\nStanford name, logo, and letterhead,\nUniversity equipment (e.g., computers and peripherals, University vehicles),\nStanford facilities,\nProcurement tools such as purchasing cards, travel cards and petty cash,\nUniversity records including student, employee, donor, sponsor, and patient records, and\nThe time and effort of staff, students and others at Stanford.\nPlease see the following policies for more information:\nPolicy on Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities\nPolicy on Unrelated Business Activity\nPolicy on Ownership and Use of Stanford Trademarks and Images\n8. Conflict of Commitment/Conflict of Interest\nUniversity Community members who are Stanford faculty and staff owe their primary professional allegiance to the University and its mission to engage in the highest level of education, research, health care and business practices.\nA conflict of commitment can arise when a person’s external activities, e.g., consulting agreements, speaking engagements, public service, personal business, etc. interfere with the person’s responsibilities to the university. A conflict of commitment usually involves issues of time allocation.\nOutside professional activities, private financial interests or the receipt of benefits or gifts from third parties can cause an actual or perceived conflict of interest.\nRelationships between Stanford and its vendors or sponsors must be free of any real or perceived impropriety or favoritism. University Community members should not solicit any gift, and should not personally accept any material gift, gratuity or payment, in cash or in kind, from any third party seeking to do business with the University or currently doing business with the University.\nIn order to protect our primary mission, University Community members with other professional or financial interests shall disclose them in compliance with applicable conflict of commitment/conflict of interest policies and, if permitted, manage them in compliance with all controls put in place. The policies are available on the following websites:\nFaculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest\nStaff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest\nConflict of Commitment and Interest for Academic Staff and Other Teaching Staff\nPolicy on Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities\nPolicy on Unrelated Business Activity\nPolicy on Ownership and Use of Stanford Trademarks and Images\n9. Response to Governmental or Other Investigations\nStanford University is committed to cooperating with government investigators as required by law. If an employee receives a subpoena, search warrant or other similar document, before taking any action, the employee must immediately contact the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Office of the General Counsel. The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for authorizing the release or copying of any University records or documents.\nIf a government investigator, agent, or auditor comes to the University, an employee should contact their supervisor and the appropriate University office before discussing University business with such investigator, agent, or auditor. If the appropriate office is unknown, the supervisor should contact the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Office of the General Counsel.\n10. Reporting Suspected Violations\nAdherence to this Code also requires that any suspected violations of applicable standards, policies, laws or regulations be brought to the attention of the appropriate cognizant office. Raising such concerns is a service to the University and does not jeopardize the University Community member’s position or employment.\na. Reporting to Management\nMembers of the University Community should report suspected violations of applicable laws, regulations, government contract and grant requirements or this Code and University policies and procedures. This reporting should normally be made initially through standard management channels, beginning with the immediate supervisor, instructor or advisor. If for any reason it is not appropriate to report suspected violations to the immediate supervisor (e.g., the suspected violation is by the supervisor), or the employee is uncomfortable doing so, individuals may go to a higher level of management within their school or department.\nb. Other Reporting\nIf for any reason it is not appropriate to report suspected violations through management channels within the school or departments, or the employee is uncomfortable doing so, individuals may go to:\nHuman Resources,\nThe Office of the Chief Risk Officer,\nThe Office of the General Counsel, \nThe Office for Institutional Equity and Access,\nThe Ethics and Compliance Helpline at: \nPhone: 650-721-2667,\nEmail: integrity@stanford.edu\nWeb Form (anonymous): helpline.stanford.edu \nEvery concern is treated seriously and reviewed in the appropriate manner.\nc. Confidentiality\nConcerns may be reported confidentially, and even anonymously, although the more information given, the easier it is to investigate the concerns. The only anonymous reporting mechanism at the University is the Compliance and Ethics Helpline web form: helpline.stanford.edu.\nd. Cooperation\nAll members of the University Community are expected to cooperate fully in the investigation of potential violations of University policy and applicable rules, laws, or regulations.\ne. Non-Retaliation\nStanford policy prohibits retaliation against an individual who in good faith reports or provides information about concerns or suspected violations. Retaliation is an adverse action taken because an individual has made a report or has participated in an investigation. An adverse action is any action that materially affects that individual's standing or terms and conditions of employment. False accusations made with the intent of harming or retaliating against another person may subject the accuser to disciplinary action. \nf. Consequences of Violation\nConfirmed violations will result in appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the University. In some circumstances, civil or criminal charges and penalties may apply."}

Individuals who take retaliatory actions will be subject to corrective action, up to and including separation from the University.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all faculty, staff and others who participate in Stanford programs and activities including Stanford affiliates providing services to Stanford such as mentors and volunteers, and other third parties, such as contractors and vendors. Its application includes Stanford programs and activities both on and off-campus, including overseas programs. Stanford has a non-retaliation policy that has broader applicability, including for students; please see Guide Memo 1.1.1: University Code of Conduct, Section 10.e.\n1. Policy Statement\nStanford University prohibits retaliation against an individual who in good faith submits a complaint, a report, an inquiry, or provides information about concerns or suspected violations of University policies or local, State, or Federal laws and regulations.\nRetaliation is any adverse action taken in response to an individual’s good-faith report or participation in a proceeding related to this policy that materially affects the individual's standing or terms and conditions of employment. Retaliation can be direct such as changing an individual’s work location, work assignments, pay or schedule, or it can be indirect such as intimidating, threatening, or harassing an individual who has raised a claim or participated as a witness in an investigation.\nIndividuals who take retaliatory actions will be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination. False accusations made with the intent of harming or retaliating against another person may subject the accuser to disciplinary action. \n2. Reporting and Resources\nReports of retaliation should be made orally or in writing and as soon as possible. The earlier the report, the easier it is to investigate and take appropriate remedial action.\nStaff who believe they have been retaliated against in violation of this policy should report their complaint to University Human Resources, Employee & Labor Relations, at stanfordelr@stanford.edu or 650-721-4272.\nThey may also direct their complaint to any of the following: \ntheir supervisor,\ntheir local Human Resources office.\nAny individual or office who receives a concern about retaliation relating to staff should report the concern to University Human Resources, Employee & Labor Relations, for follow-up as appropriate.\nFaculty who believe they have been retaliated against in violation of this policy should report their concerns to the applicable Dean’s Office.\nOther Resources\nOther resources are also available to faculty and staff to report or discuss their concerns. \nConcerns may be reported anonymously through the Ethics and Compliance Helpline.\nDiscussion of concerns with the following offices will not constitute “notice” to the University, nor will it create a record of the concerns with the University: \nThe University Ombuds at 650-497-1542,\nThe School of Medicine Ombuds at 650-498-5744,\nThe Faculty & Staff Help Center at 650-723-4577, and\nThe Office for Religious & Spiritual Life at 650-723-1762."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/academic-and-business-relationships-third-parties/academic","text":"1.4.1 Academic and Business Relationships With Third Parties\nLast Updated\nAugust 11, 2014 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 14\nFrom time to time, the University enters into agreements with various independent entities that may result in an ongoing business or academic relationship with the University. For example, entities with current relationships include Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford Bookstore, Inc., and Stanford Federal Credit Union.\nAlthough these types of entities remain independent from the University, nonetheless, the nature of the relationships makes it desirable to outline how the relationships might be structured. This Guide Memo also provides guidance to University officers, faculty and staff concerning issues that might arise and that need to be addressed prior to entering into such third party agreements.\n1. General Guidelines\na. Potential Issues\nThe agreement between the University and the other entity should make adequate provision for issues that may be called into play by the nature of the proposed relationship. Such issues might include the following:\nPotential property tax or unrelated business income tax imposed on the University\nFailure to appropriately file for a property tax exemption associated with leases of on-campus or off-campus space\nGovernment contract and similar allocation issues\nVicarious liability to the University and indemnities\nIssues relating to public image or government scrutiny\nEffects on legal compliance of University benefit plans\nAll aspects of land use and landowner issues regarding environmental matters\nThe potential for liens or claims against Stanford property or assets\nFraud and abuse issues in the medical area\nEmployment law issues\nPrivate inurement or private use where University assets, income or facilities may be used in a way that benefits or results in profits to private individuals or entities\nUtilities issues\nConflicts of interest\nThe potential triggering of other statutes or governmental regulations\nb. Definition of Relationship\nThe agreement should provide a clear definition of the nature of the relationship and of any responsibilities or obligations undertaken by the parties. The agreement should also address appropriate limitations on those responsibilities or obligations in both time and scope; the defense and indemnification of the University in the event of suit or other adverse action; the need for the University to be named as an additional insured on policies of insurance; the right of the University to review financial records of the entity, where appropriate in light of the relationship; and a date for termination or reevaluation of the agreement and relationship.\nc. Form of Agreement\nA detailed contract will not always be necessary; often a well-drafted business letter agreement may suffice. Whatever form the agreement takes, the other parties need to understand that the University does not seek to intrude inappropriately into the internal affairs of the other parties and in no way is taking on responsibility for their actions—except as to specified actions (if any) for specific reasons that are relevant to the relationship and are clearly delineated in the agreement.\nLand, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/Real Estate department must receive a copy of any lease agreement made with third parties, for consideration of property tax or property tax exemption issues.\n2. Approvals and Consultations\na. Delegated Authority\nThe appropriate office or offices for reviewing and/or approving an agreement will depend upon the areas in which the proposed relationship arises. In this regard, please refer to the relevant resolutions and memoranda concerning delegations of authority by the University President, Vice Presidents and other senior officers. For more information concerning such delegations, contact the Office of the Secretary of the Board of Trustees.\nb. Cognizant Offices\nThe following are examples of elements that may be present or contemplated and the corresponding office that needs to be consulted and whose approval generally will be required in connection with that element:\nElement Office \nUse of buildings or other facilities on Stanford academic land\n\t\nLand, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/University Architect/Campus Planning and Design (UA/CPD)\n\t\nUse of buildings or other facilities on \nStanford non-academic land\n\tLBRE/Real Estate department\t\nApplication for appropriate property tax exemption in connection with any on-campus or off-campus lease\n\tLBRE/Real Estate department\t\nUse of Stanford's accounting or payroll systems\n\tController's Office\t\nUse of Stanford's benefits programs\tBenefits Department\t\nReliance on Stanford's insurance or self-insurance\tOffice of Risk Management\t\nUse of Stanford's networks or computing resources\n\tExecutive Director of IT Services\t\nUse of Stanford's purchasing services\tPurchasing Department\t\nUse of Stanford University Medical Center services or facilities\n\t\nThe Dean of the School of Medicine, the Chief Executive Officer of Stanford Health Care or the Chief Executive Officer of Lucile Salter Packard Children’s Hospital (for activities involving their respective organizations)\n\t\nUse of the Stanford name, marks or tax identification number\n\t\nThe Provost (for activities involving teaching or research), the Dean of the School of Medicine (for matters involving any medical activities at the School of Medicine), the Chief Executive Officer of Stanford Health Care (for matters involving any medical activities at Stanford Health Care), the Chief Executive Officer of Lucile Salter Packard Children’s Hospital (for matters involving any medical activities at Lucile Salter Packard Children’s Hospital), the Director of Business Development (for matters involving use of Stanford tradenames or products or services offered for sale to the general public) and the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer (in all other situations)\n\t\nPersonnel Appointments (of the entity's personnel to Stanford's faculty or staff, or of Stanford personnel to the staff or governing body of the entity\n\t\nThe Provost (for activities involving teaching or research), the Dean of the School of Medicine (for matters involving medical activities), and the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer (in all other situations)\n\t\nToxic or Hazardous Materials\tOffice of Environmental Health and Safety\t\nCampus Sales (by Outside vendors)\tThe Director of Business Development\t\nIncome to Stanford\tController's Office\t\nLicensing of Technology\tOffice of Technology Licensing \t\nc. Guidance on Legal or Liability Issues\nAs a general proposition, if the arrangement presents novel legal issues, or if the Stanford entities involved in the relationship would like general legal guidance, the Office of the General Counsel should also be consulted. Similarly, the Risk Management Department should be consulted on proposed relationships that raise risk or liability concerns, or whenever Stanford personnel expect their activities (whether on-site or off-site) to be covered by the University's policies of insurance and self-insurance.\n3. Situations not Covered By This Guide Memo\nThe following situations or types of agreements are not covered by this Guide Memo:\nConferences and summer camps\nArrangements with individuals to become visiting scholars\nConsulting agreements with individuals\nExternally-sponsored projects and gift-supported programs\nFinancial investments managed by the Stanford Management Company\nReal estate investments managed by LBRE\nThe procurement of goods or services for University use in the ordinary course of business\nNormal business and licensing transactions entered into by the Office of Technology Licensing\n4.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/conflict-interest/political-campaign-and-lobbying","text":"1.5.1 Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 15.1\nStanford University supports the expression and discussion of ideas and opinions and encourages members of the University community to be informed and engaged citizens. At the same time, however, Stanford is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding political activities, such as campaign activities, lobbying, and the giving of gifts to public officials. This results in part because of the University’s status as a non-profit 501(c)(3) entity.\nWhile all members of the University community may express their political opinions and engage in political activities, it is very important that they do so only in their individual capacities and avoid even the appearance that they are speaking or acting for the University in political matters. The University expressly disavows any political opinions or activities that are not made in accordance with these provisions: such opinions and activities are not authorized and may not be attributed to the University.\nIn the limited circumstances where individuals must speak or act on behalf of the University regarding political issues, they must do so in accordance with the provisions of this Guide Memo.\nApplicability: This policy applies to all members of the University community (including current faculty, students and staff).\n1. Summary of Legal Requirements and Restrictions\na. Campaign Activities\nContributions of money, goods, or services to candidates for political office, political parties or political action committees, and in support of or opposition to ballot measure campaigns are subject to a wide variety of political laws. Depending on the jurisdiction and the campaign, political contributions may be prohibited or limited and, in nearly all cases, are subject to a complicated series of disclosure rules. Because of the University's tax-exempt status, the University is legally prohibited from endorsing or opposing candidates for political office or making any contribution of money, goods, or services to candidates, political parties or political action committees. It is important, therefore, that no person cause the University to make such a contribution.\nb. Lobbying\nLobbying can generally be described as any attempt to influence the action of any legislative body (e.g., Congress, state legislatures, county boards, city councils and their staffs) or any federal, state, or local government agency. Laws regulating lobbying exist at the federal, state, and local levels and can differ widely in scope, depending on the jurisdiction. Some laws, for example, only regulate lobbying of the legislative branch. Others, however, also cover lobbying of administrative agencies and officers in the executive branch (e.g., lobbying for federally-funded grants). To one degree or another, however, most lobbying laws require registration and reporting by individuals engaged in attempts to influence governmental action.\nTax-exempt organizations are permitted to lobby, and the University engages in lobbying on a limited number of issues, mostly those affecting education, research, and related activities. There is usually some threshold of time or money spent on lobbying that triggers registration and reporting requirements. Regardless of thresholds, however, no University employee—other than the following individuals, on matters under their jurisdiction—may lobby on behalf of the University without specific authorization:\nPresident\nProvost\nDeans of the Seven Schools\nVice Provost and Dean of Research\nVice Provost for Graduate Education\nVice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer\nVice President of Human Resources\nVice President for Land, Buildings and Real Estate\nDirector of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\nDirector of the Hoover Institution\nGeneral Counsel\nVice President for External Relations\nVice President for Government Affairs\nThe Vice Provost and Dean of Research may grant permission to faculty members to lobby on behalf of the University for specific purposes. The Vice President for Government Affairs may grant permission to staff members to lobby on behalf of the University for specific purposes. All lobbying on behalf of the University should be coordinated with the Vice President for Government Affairs. Please see the Federal Lobbying Guidelines for Stanford Faculty and Staff in the Research Policy Handbook.\nc. Giving of Gifts to Public Officials and Staff\nAlmost all jurisdictions have strict rules on the extent to which gifts and honoraria may be given to public officials (both elected and non-elected officials and, often, staff). In some cases gifts and honoraria are prohibited; in others they are limited; and in most cases they are subject to detailed disclosure. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as California, gifts to both state and local public officials can result in a public official's disqualification from participation in any governmental action affecting the interests of the donor. Meals, travel, and entertainment are the most common types of gifts, but gift rules can also apply in cases where public officials attend a reception or receive tickets to sporting or other events.\nAs a non-profit organization, the University generally does not give gifts to public officials and, in those limited cases where it does give such gifts, it must do so in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, any University employee who, on behalf of the University, wishes to make a gift to a public official must receive prior approval from the Vice President for Government Affairs before making such a gift.\nd. Reporting of Political Activities\nThe University must report most of its political activities above certain thresholds. Therefore, any University employee engaging in such activities on behalf of the University should carefully review the remainder of this Guide Memo and should discuss the relevant activities in advance with the Vice President for Government Affairs.\n2. Prohibited and Restricted Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities\na. In General:\nNo person may, on behalf of the University, engage in any political campaign activity in support of or opposition to any candidate for elective public office (including giving or receiving funds or endorsements), political party or political action committee, nor shall any University resources be used for such purpose.\nNo person may, on behalf of the University, lobby (or use University resources to lobby) any federal, state, or local legislative or administrative official or staff member unless specifically authorized to do so. Any lobbying activity, even when authorized, must be conducted in compliance with this Guide Memo, other applicable University policies, and applicable law. University resources include, but are not limited to, Interdepartmental Mail, equipment, personnel, supplies, computer resources, and email lists. See, e.g., Administrative Guide Memo 6.2.1(2)(c)(4), Computer and Network Usage Policy.\nNo person may, on behalf of the University, give a gift (or use any University resources to give a gift) to any federal, state, or local official or staff member, except in compliance with this Guide Memo, other applicable University policies, and applicable law.\nNo person supporting or opposing candidates for public office, political parties or political action or engaging in other political campaign activities may use University space or facilities or receive University support, except in the limited ways described in section 3.a.\nNo person may use for lobbying activities federally-funded contract or grant money received by the University.\nEven the foregoing activities that are only restricted, rather than prohibited, may be subject to limitations imposed by law. Therefore, any person engaging in the activity, or contemplating doing so, should consult with the Vice President for Government Affairs (who will consult with the General Counsel's Office). SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory may have additional restrictions related to political activity; for guidance specific to SLAC, contact SLAC's Communication Department.\nb. Guidelines for Avoiding Prohibited Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities\nThe following guidelines should assist in preventing the involvement or apparent involvement of the University in political activities, such as in support of or opposition to any candidate for elective public office (including both partisan and non-partisan elections). Except in the limited circumstances set forth in section 3.b., below:\n(1) Use of Name and Seal\nNeither the name nor seal of the University or of any of its schools, departments, or institutions should be used on letters or other materials intended to influence such political elections.\n(2) Use of Address and Telephones\nNo University office should be used as a return mailing address for such political mailings, and telephone service that is paid by the University, likewise, should not be used for such political purposes. (A student's dormitory room and telephone service that are personal to the student may be used for these purposes.)\n(3) Use of Title\nThe University title of a faculty or staff member or other person should be used only for identification and should be accompanied by a statement that the person is speaking as an individual and not as a representative of the University.\n(4) Use of Services, Resources and Equipment\nUniversity services (such as Interdepartmental Mail), equipment and other resources (such as copy machines, computers and computer resources, email lists, and telephones) and supplies should not be used for such political purposes.\n(5) Use of Personnel\nNo University employee may, as part of their job, be asked to perform tasks in any way related to prohibited political purposes.\n3. Permissible Political Activities\na. In General\nAs noted above, the federal, state, and local laws which limit the political activities that can take place in University facilities and with University support in no way inhibit the expression of personal political views by any individual in the University community. Nor do they forbid faculty, students, or staff from joining others in support of candidates for office or in furtherance of political causes, including political activities that are permitted in this Guide. There is no restriction on discussion of political issues or teaching of political techniques. Academic endeavors which address public policy issues are in no way prohibited or constrained. See, e.g., the Office of Special Events and Protocol Political Activities Policy and the Office of Student Engagement Political Activities Policy.\nBecause the University encourages freedom of expression, there is an array of political activities which do not reasonably imply University involvement or identification that may be undertaken so long as University procedures are followed for use of facilities. Examples of permissible activities are:\nUse of areas, such as White Plaza, by registered Stanford student organizations, University schools, institutes, and recognized departments for tables, speeches, and other permissible activities--subject to approval by the Office of Student Engagement (for student activities) or the Office of Special Events and Protocol (for school, department or institute activities).\nUse of auditoriums or outdoor spaces for speeches by political candidates who are speaking in a non-candidate capacity and subject to rules of the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Election Commission, and the California Fair Political Practices Commission, and other applicable laws and University policies. These events must be organized by registered Stanford student organizations or University schools, institutes, and recognized departments. Arrangements must be made with the Office of Special Events and Protocol or the Office of Student Engagement, in consultation with the Office of Government Affairs, and are subject to policies that have been established by those offices for non-candidate capacity appearances (including no signage or distribution of campaign materials, no solicitation of votes or donations, etc.). See, e.g., Office of Special Events and Protocol political activities policy and Office of Student Engagement event planning guidelines. These policies also apply to all virtual events, webinars and symposia using varied software technologies. See also the University Events policy and the Stanford Event Organizer for more information.\nNon-Stanford entities are prohibited from inviting media to the Stanford University campus for any events. Stanford schools, institutes, recognized departments, and registered student organizations interested in press/media participation must work with University Communications and the Office of Government Affairs and adhere to university press/media policies. The University will have sole responsibility for deciding whether the press/media will be invited to the event and will handle any such invitations.\nTo reiterate, because tax and political compliance laws impose restrictions, or prohibitions, on certain political activities and on the use of buildings and equipment at a non-profit institution such as the University, any such activities must be in compliance with these legal requirements. Similarly, any activities must comply with local, county, state and federal and University guidelines regarding health and safety requirements, such as with regard to COVID-19.\nIndividuals taking political positions for themselves or groups with which they are associated, but not as representatives of the University, should clearly state, by words (such as an express disclaimer) and actions, that their positions are not those of the University and are not being taken in an official capacity on behalf of the University.\nb. Limited University Political Activities\nLimited activities relating to specific federal, state, or local legislation or ballot initiatives are permissible where (1) the subject matter is directly related to core interests of the University's activities; (2) the President has determined that the University should take a position; and (3) the individuals who speak or write on the University's behalf are specifically authorized to do so.\n4. Research Involving Political Campaigns\nAny Stanford researcher considering doing research involving current or future elections or political campaigns should confer with the Vice Provost and Dean of Research (who will consult with the General Counsel's Office for any legal restrictions), and should submit the research proposal in advance to Stanford's Institutional Review Board as appropriate under its policies and procedures.\n5. Responsibility for Interpretation\nThe Vice President for External Relations, in consultation with the Vice President for Government Affairs, and/or the General Counsel, is the administrative officer responsible for interpretation and application of the above guidelines. Questions on whether planned student activities are consistent with the University's obligations should be directed to the Office of Student Engagement, which will consult with the Vice President for External Relations. All other questions on whether planned school, department or institute or other activities are consistent with the University's obligations should be addressed directly to the Office of Special Events & Protocol, which will consult with the Vice President for External Relations."}

Academic Staff are covered by Research Policy Handbook 4.4: Conflict of Commitment and Interest. This Guide Memo summarizes existing policies and practices applicable to other University employees. Additional University policies are applicable to employees in individual departments and units, e.g., SLAC, Sponsored Projects and Purchasing Services. Individuals who use the department's services must follow the department's policies.\nPurpose: When University staff members, or members of their immediate families (defined below), have significant financial interests in, or consulting or employment arrangements with, other business concerns, it is important to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest between their University obligations and their outside interests.\nIn addition to the conflict of interest concerns mentioned above—which apply to all University staff—Stanford staff members who are exempt from governmental regulations regarding compensation for overtime work owe their primary professional allegiance to the University. Care should be taken so that external activities do not result in inappropriate conflicts of commitment, i.e., conflicts regarding allocation of time and energies.\nIn order to preclude inappropriate actual or apparent conflicts of interest or conflicts of commitment, this Guide Memo sets forth related University policies and procedures.\n1.

Approvals\nParticipation in negotiating or giving final approval to financial or other business transactions between the University and other organizations in which the individual or an immediate family member has a Significant Financial Interest or with which the individual or an Immediate Family Member has an employment or consulting arrangement.\nAll staff should also note that originating or approving financial or other business transactions between the University and other organizations with which the staff member has any financial or family ties (even those not rising to the level of Significant Financial Interest or constituting an Immediate Family Member) may create the appearance of a conflict of interest. It is required that all such situations be disclosed in writing to the cognizant University officer and this disclosure should be documented and retained for the duration of the business relationship.\nd. Gratuities and Special Favors\nAcceptance of gratuities, unsolicited gifts exceeding $50 in value, solicited gifts in any amount or special favors from private or public organizations or individuals with which the University does or may conduct business or extending gratuities or special favors to employees of any sponsoring government or other agency or entity.\ne.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/conflict-interest/unrelated-business-activity","text":"1.5.3 Unrelated Business Activity | Administrative Guide\nAuthority\nApproved by the Administrative Council April 1, 1987. It is reissued with approval of the Provost's Office and Controller's Office.\nLast Updated\nDecember 15, 2010 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 15.3\n1. Policy\nStanford's resources exist to support the University's missions of creation, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge. The University's assets must be preserved for these purposes, not for the personal gain of individuals nor for outside parties' uses which do not further Stanford's academic objectives. The University receives frequent requests for access to its resources by outside entities, typically in exchange for some form of compensation to Stanford. Many of these, if granted, would constitute unrelated business activities. The purpose of this statement is to remind the University community that it is Stanford policy not to engage in unrelated business activities.\nUnrelated business activities have the potential for distorting the University's primary teaching and research missions. Furthermore, revenues from such activities generally are taxable under the Internal Revenue Code, and thus carry consequences to the University in terms of income tax liability. They also can have implications for property tax as well as product liability, and they can create unfair competition with the for-profit sector.\nPermission to engage in unrelated business activities at Stanford may be granted only by the Provost, and then only in those cases in which there is strong likelihood that the activity will significantly benefit the University as a whole.\n2. Definition\na. Generation of Revenue\nFor the purpose of this statement, \"unrelated business activities\" are activities that use Stanford resources to generate revenue from third parties, and that are unrelated in a programmatic sense to the teaching, research, and other educational functions of the University. An unrelated activity normally would not be thought to further the University's teaching or research activities, except for the revenue it produces. Because the Internal Revenue Code does not define with precision what activities are unrelated for tax purposes, a general rule of thumb to apply is to assume that any activity undertaken primarily for the revenue it produces is likely to be unrelated.\nb. Support of Mission\nHowever, there are certain activities which might at first appear to be unrelated, but which, under scrutiny, are in fact related in a programmatic sense or provide direct support to Stanford's academic missions. For example, certain services or programs may be conducted on campus for the convenience of University faculty, staff and students, such as food sales at Tresidder.\n3. Implementation and Exceptions\na. Need for Review\nBecause of the necessarily imprecise definition of \"unrelated,\" activities that would generate income and are proposed to be undertaken on behalf of an outside party that involve the use of University lands, buildings or instrumentation or the rendering of services by University personnel must be reviewed in the context of the unit's programmatic mission, Internal Revenue regulations and prior case rulings before they may be approved. Examples include fabrication by University machine shops, testing or analysis of materials, use of University computer facilities and similar activities.\nb. Responsibility\nThe responsibility for implementing this policy rests with line management. If a department chair, director, or dean has any question as to whether a proposed arrangement under their purview might constitute an unrelated business activity, it is their responsibility to have the activity reviewed by the cognizant vice president's office, who in turn may need to seek counsel from the Controller's Office—University Tax Director. Questions arising from departments or schools reporting to the Provost should be directed to the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.\nc. Exceptions\nIf the cognizant vice president endorses a request for an arrangement that is determined to be an unrelated business activity, the proposal should be forwarded to the Controller's Office for a review of the potential tax consequences, and means of accommodating them, before the request is sent to the Provost for approval."}

Lists of the current names of both administrative and academic officers are published in the Stanford University Bulletin and in the Stanford University Faculty/Staff Directory.\n1. Founding of the University\na. Founding Grant\nThe Leland Stanford Junior University was founded by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford on November 11, 1885, in memory of their only child. The founding of the University was accomplished by a Grant of Endowment after Senator Stanford had procured passage on March 9, 1885, of an enabling act by the legislature of the State of California. The Founding Grant conveyed to trustees certain properties, directed that a university be established, and outlined the objectives and government of the university.\nb. Amendments\nThe Founding Grant reserved to the Founders the right to amend the Grant. In the years following the death of Senator Stanford in 1893, Mrs. Stanford made several amendments in the form of addresses to the Board of Trustees on such points as the nonsectarian, nonpartisan nature of the University, the powers of the President, duties of the Trustees, financial management, housing on campus, gifts from others than the Founders, summer schools, research, and tuition.\nc. Legislation and Court Decrees\nThe University operated under the Founding Grant without complications until Senator Stanford's death. However, some problems became apparent in connection with the transfer of the trust money to the Trustees, the taxation of property and revenue, and the legal status of the University. Provisions were presented to and approved by the California legislature to correct defects, and the Trustees were authorized to petition the courts for judicial decrees in matters concerning the legal status of the University and the role of the Trustees.\nd. Information About the Founding\nDetailed accounts of the steps taken in the founding of Stanford University, the texts of the various legal documents, and the history of the University are in the University Archives in the Green Library. The University also publishes a booklet, The Founding Grant with Amendments, Legislation, and Court Decrees, and a listing of some general works of history can be found in the bibliography of the Faculty Handbook\n2. The Board of Trustees\na. Powers and Duties\nThe Board of Trustees is custodian of the endowment and all the properties of the University. The Board administers the invested fund, sets the annual budget, and determines policies for operation and control of the University. The powers and duties of the Board of Trustees derive from The Founding Grant, Amendments, Legislation, and Court Decrees. In addition, the Board operates under its own bylaws and a series of resolutions of major policy.\nb. Membership\nBoard membership is set at a maximum of 38 including the President of the University, who serves ex officio and with vote. Eight of the Trustees are elected or appointed in accordance with the Rules Governing the Election or Appointment of Alumni Nominated Trustees. All members of the Board serve five-year terms and, in general, are eligible to serve two such consecutive terms (except alumni nominated trustees, who serve one five-year term only).\nc. Officers of the Board\nThe Officers of the Board are the chair, one or more vice chairs, the secretary, and the associate secretary. Officers are elected to one-year terms, with the exception of the Chair, who serves a two-year term. Their terms of office begin July 1.\nd. Committees\nThe six standing committees of the Board are the Committee on Audit, Compliance and Risk; the Committee on Development; the Committee on Finance; the Committee on Land and Buildings; the Committee on Student, Alumni and External Affairs; and the Committee on Trusteeship.

Appointment\nAmong the powers given to the Trustees by the Founding Grant is the power and duty to appoint a President of the University, who shall not at the time of appointment be one of their number, and to remove their at will. In accordance with the by-laws of the Board of Trustees, the President of the University shall be appointed or removed only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Trustees.\nb. Powers and Duties\nThe by-laws and resolutions of the Board of Trustees set forth the following duties of the President of the University in addition to those he derives from the Founding Grant or by office:\n\"He shall be responsible for the management of the University and all its departments, including the operation of the physical plant and the administration of the University's business activities.\"\n\"The President shall report to the Board at each regular meeting on problems and progress of the University, and he shall make recommendations for action.\"\n\"In conformance with general objectives approved by the Board, he shall be responsible for preparation of the annual University operating budget and other annual budgets as specified. He shall submit these budgets to the Board for review and subsequent action and shall submit periodic reports to the Board on the status of plans and projections basic to preparation of budgets for succeeding years.\"\nc. Appointment of Staff\nTo assist in the performance of presidential duties, the President of the University, with the approval of the Board, appoints and prescribes the powers and duties of a Provost, a Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer, a Vice President for Medical Affairs, a Vice President for Development, and a General Counsel. The President of the University, with the approval of the Board, may appoint and prescribe the powers and duties of other officers and employees as the President may deem proper.\nd. Absence or Inability to Act\nIn the absence or inability to act of the President, the Provost shall be Acting President and shall perform the duties of the President of the University. If both the President and the Provost are unable to act or otherwise believe the circumstances warrant, the President (or Provost when functioning as President) may designate one or more persons to act on the President's behalf. In emergencies, the Chair of the Board of Trustees may designate one or more persons to act on the President's behalf or as Acting President and, if the tenure exceeds 30 days, such designation must be confirmed by the Board.\n4. The Provost\na. Responsibilities\nThe Provost, as the chief academic and budget officer, administers the academic program (instruction and research in schools and other unaffiliated units) and University services in support of the academic program (student affairs, libraries, information resources, and institutional planning).

Such situations include, but are not limited to, use of Marks in connection with materials which (i) violate any law or regulation, (ii) have the potential to offend a person or group on the basis of gender, ethnic origin, religion, race, disability or sexual orientation, (iii) could be considered to be pornographic, or (iv) could be considered to be defamatory. \nIn connection with partisan political activities. See Administrative Guide Memo 1.5.1: Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities.\nInvolvement by individual faculty, staff, students, or alumni in a non-Stanford activity is not a sufficient basis for indicating University sponsorship or endorsement and Marks may not be used in connection with such activities.\n5. Trademark Licensing Program\nAll merchandise bearing any Marks must be produced by a licensed vendor and be approved by Stanford’s Trademark Licensing Office. The Trademark Licensing Office will issue or approve all licenses, issue guidelines governing the production, sale and other distribution of licensed merchandise, and manage Stanford’s trademark licensing program.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/protection-minors/protection-minors","text":"1.8.1 Protection of Minors | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nJune 10, 2022 \nEffective Date\nMay 29, 2015 \nPrint\nApplicability: This policy applies to all university departments and organizations. Athletic camps, academic camps, licensed childcare facilities, instructional programs, and other organized programs and activities intended for minors are within the scope of this policy, whether they are limited to daily activities, involve the housing of minors in residence halls, take place virtually/online, or take place off campus as part of a program directed or sponsored by Stanford (“Covered Programs”).\n1. Definitions\n“Minor”: Any person under the age of 18.\n“Covered Program”: Any activity directed or sponsored by Stanford and intended for Minors, whether in-person or virtual/online. Covered Programs also include programs and activities intended for Minors that are operated by a third party organization on Stanford’s campus. Covered Programs do not include: single performances or events open to the general public not targeted toward Minors, events or social functions that may be attended by Minors who are accompanied by their parents/guardians, or organized school field trips or tours where Minors are under the supervision of an authorized adult or adults.\n“Program Staff”: Administrators, faculty, staff, students, and volunteers who work directly with, supervise, chaperone or otherwise oversee Minors in Covered Programs.\n“Live Scan”: The required method of criminal background check for Program Staff working with Minors. This method uses a fingerprinting device and must include results from the California Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For information on completing a Live Scan background check, contact University Human Resources.\n2. Purpose and Scope of Policy\nStanford University is dedicated to the welfare and safety of all persons who participate in university-sponsored events. However, because Minors are a particularly vulnerable population, Stanford takes extra precautions to protect Minors who participate in activities and programs on Stanford’s campus or under the authority and direction of the university at other locations. Stanford expects all members of the university community to adhere to and act in accordance with this policy.\nThis policy describes the responsibilities of Program Staff and informs all members of the university community of their obligation to report any instances of inappropriate behavior involving Minors (see Section 7: Appropriate Behavior with Minors). Failure to comply with the requirements set forth in this policy may lead to disciplinary action (up to and including termination) and/or revocation of the opportunity to use Stanford facilities and land.\nAlthough Stanford is committed to the welfare and appropriate treatment of all Minors, the administrative requirements of this policy do not apply to programs or activities involving:\nMatriculated Stanford students who are Minors.\nMinors who are employed at Stanford. However, if a Minor employee will be working in a Covered Program, they will be required to complete a Live Scan background check and training as required by this policy.\nMinors participating in Institutional Review Board approved research.\nPatient care-related activities pertaining to Minors at Stanford Hospital or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. These activities are addressed in relevant health care policies.\nThe Program Staff background check and training requirements of this policy do not apply for individual events lasting one day or less. However, these events must still be registered with University Human Resources and have adequate adult supervision, and Program Staff must abide by Stanford's Guidelines for Appropriate Behavior with Minors. In addition, Program Staff for these events must include at least one identified adult staff person present at all times who has a current background check on file.\nIn the event an exception to this policy appears to be necessary, the unique facts of the situation and business necessity should be discussed in advance with University Human Resources. When necessary, cognizant Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts, or university officers will be included in the decision making of proposed exceptions. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Vice President for Human Resources.\n3. Minors Not Participating in University-Sponsored Activities\nStanford, as a research university, is generally not a proper environment for Minors unless they are participating in an authorized program or activity and adequately supervised by adults who have the appropriate training and credentials. Accordingly:\nStanford students who have a Minor relative, friend or other guest stay with them on campus must comply with the Guest Policy in their Residence Agreement. Minor guests must be accompanied in the residence by their host, and must be registered with the Housing Service Center when required under the Guest Policy.\nDaycare or babysitting services are not permitted except if provided by one of Stanford’s NAEYC-accredited Early Education and Childcare centers, or by a licensed vendor who complies with all state licensing requirements and is authorized by Stanford to offer the services. In-home childcare arrangements in private residences located on Stanford lands are permitted.\nPursuant to other university policies and/or Federal and/or State laws and regulations, Minors should not be present in certain facilities and environments. If a parent or guardian brings their Minor child to work, the parent or guardian is responsible for the Minor’s welfare and must ensure that the Minor child does not visit such restricted locations.\nIn general, Minors should not be left unsupervised on Stanford’s campus. It is the responsibility of those who bring Minors to campus (including Program Sponsors or third party organizations) to ensure appropriate supervision. Certain Covered Programs for high school age students do allow limited unsupervised time on campus, with parental authorization and subject to any program rules and restrictions.\n4. Requirements for Sponsoring Covered Programs\na. Register the Program\nEach Covered Program operated by the university must have an identified Stanford department serving as the Program Sponsor, represented by a Department Chair, Senior Staff, or Institute Director. The Program Sponsor must be one of the following:\nStanford University academic department, school, or institute\nStanford administrative office operating on behalf of the university\nNon-academic departments recognized by the President's Office, such as Athletics\nFor additional information, see the Office of Special Events & Protocol's University Events Policy and the Stanford Event Organizer.\nEach Covered Program operated by a third party must be reviewed and approved by the university through a process established by University Human Resources. If the Third Party Program is approved, University Human Resources will serve as its Program Sponsor on behalf of the university.\nThe Program Sponsor must register the program with University Human Resources using the Protection of Minors Management System. The registration form will require Program Sponsors to provide a description, dates, and location of the program, the expected age range and estimated number of Minors.\nAfter the program is registered, the Program Sponsor will be required to enter the names and contact information for planned Program Staff into the Protection of Minors Management System sufficiently in advance of the Covered Program start date to allow time for Program Staff to complete Live Scan background checks and training as required by this policy. For Third Party Programs, Program Staff information must be provided to University Human Resources by the third party organization.\nThe Program Sponsor is also responsible for obtaining required medical and emergency contact information and liability waivers from the parent/guardian of each participating Minor before they may participate in a Covered Program. The liability waivers must be submitted into the Protection of Minors Management System. The medical information forms must be maintained securely outside of the Protection of Minors Management System by the Program Sponsor for programs operated by Stanford and by the third party organization for Third Party Programs. The medical information forms are not required for programs that take place virtually/online only.Assistance with the registration process is available at: http://protectminors.stanford.edu.\nb. Live Scan Background Check Requirements for Program Staff Working with Minors\nUnless specifically excluded under this policy, all Program Staff must undergo a Live Scan background check before working with Minors in a Covered Program. For Covered Programs operated by a third party, the third party organization must ensure that a current Live Scan background check has been completed for all Program Staff, and inform Stanford of any relevant criminal record that was identified for any of these individuals. In the event that a relevant criminal record is revealed for any proposed Program Staff, a review committee comprised of University Human Resources, the local Human Resources office, Office of the General Counsel and/or Risk Management will assess background check results and, in consultation with the Program Sponsor as necessary, make a determination as to whether the individual should be allowed to work in the Covered Program.\nGuest speakers who participate in a Covered Program for one day or less but do not supervise, chaperone, or otherwise oversee minors, are not required to undergo a Live Scan background check. Such guest speakers must at all times work under the direct supervision of Program Staff who have current Live Scan background checks on file.\nc. Required Training\nIn recognition of the imperative of protecting Minors, unless specifically excluded under this policy, all Program Staff must receive training regarding the following prior to the program start date:\nRecognizing sexual abuse, child abuse and neglect and obligation and avenues to report suspected incidents\nAppropriate ratio of adults to Minors\nAppropriate behavior with Minors\nTraining may be accessed online from University Human Resources, or at http://protectminors.stanford.edu.\nFor Covered Programs operated by third parties, the third party organization is required to ensure that all Program Staff undergo training on these topics, understand their obligations, and agree to comply.\n5. Minimum Appropriate Staffing Ratio of Adults to Minors\nStaffing needs for Covered Programs may vary depending on the type of program, the activities involved, and requirements imposed by the Program Sponsor. However, all Covered Programs must meet the following minimum staffing ratios:\nAppropriate Staffing Ratio of Adults to Minors\nParticipant AgeNumber of StaffNumber of Overnight ParticipantsNumber of Day-Only Participants\n0-5 years\t1\t5\t6\t\n6-8 years\t1\t6\t8\t\n9-13 years\t1\t8\t10\t\n14-17 years\t1\t10\t12\t\nThe minimum staffing ratios do not apply to programs that take place virtually/online only. However, Program Staff of virtual/online programs must abide by the university’s Guidelines for Online Minors Programs, at http://protectminors.stanford.edu.\n6. Appropriate Behavior with Minors\nAdults should be positive role models for Minors, and act in a caring, honest, respectful and responsible manner that is consistent with the mission and guiding principles of the university. The behavior of all members of the Stanford community is expected to align at all times with Guide Memo 1.1.1: University Code of Conduct. In addition, all members must abide by the university’s Guidelines for Appropriate Behavior with Minors, at http://protectminors.stanford.edu.\n7. Report Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior\n\"If you see something, say something.\" Every member of the university community has an obligation to report immediately instances or suspected instances of abuse or inappropriate behavior involving Minors. This includes information about suspected abuse, neglect, or inadequate care provided by any Program Staff. Reports should be made to the Program Sponsor and University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations at (650) 721-4272.\nIndividuals identified as Mandated Reporters are legally obligated to immediately report known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect to authorities. A written report must be made to the same authorities within 10 hours. Mandated Reporters making a report in good faith will be protected from criminal and civil liability for making the report. Further, it is the policy of the university that no person making a good faith report of suspected abuse or neglect will be retaliated against in the terms and conditions of employment or educational program. More information about Mandated Reporters may be found on the HR Systems and Processes website: https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/hr-systems-and-processes/processes/mandated-reporter."}

Protection against Discrimination\n(a)\nStanford University does not discriminate on the basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, reproductive health decision-making, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, military status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law, in connection with any aspect of employment at Stanford.\n(b)\nHarassment on the basis of any legally protected characteristic is a form of discrimination and is likewise prohibited by this university policy. Prohibited harassment occurs if a hostile environment has been created that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to unreasonably interfere with a person's work performance or participation in university activities.\nProhibited harassment may take the form of (but is not limited to) offensive slurs, jokes, and other offensive oral, written, computer-generated, visual or physical conduct which is aimed at an individual or group because of their protected status.\n3. Affirmative Action\nAs a matter of institutional policy and consistent with its obligation as a federal government contractor, Stanford University is committed to principles of diversity and affirmative action, and will comply with all affirmative action requirements in accordance with law.\n4. Internal Reporting and Resources\nThe university encourages any person who believes that they have been discriminated against or harassed in violation of this policy, or observes or is otherwise aware of an incident of discrimination or harassment, to report the incident promptly.\nEmployees have various options to report discrimination and harassment and are not required to complain directly to their supervisor. However, a supervisor or manager who receives a complaint of discrimination or harassment, or observes or is otherwise aware of an incident of discrimination or harassment, is required to inform the appropriate university office, as set forth below.\nMaking a false report or providing false information may be grounds for discipline in the absence of a good faith belief that the report/information is true.\n(a) Staff or Applicants (including complaints against staff)\nComplaints of discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation in violation of this policy can be made to:\nUniversity Human Resources, Employee & Labor Relations, at stanfordelr@stanford.edu or 650-721-4272.\nComplaints can also be made to any of the following:\nA supervisor/manager\nThe local Human Resources office\nThe SHARE Title IX Office at titleix@stanford.edu or 650-497-4955, for concerns regarding sexual harassment\nAnonymously through the Ethics and Compliance Helpline\nAny individual or office who receives a concern about discrimination or harassment relating to staff or applicants should report the concern to University Human Resources, Employee & Labor Relations at stanfordelr@stanford.edu or 650-721-4272.\n(b) Faculty\nComplaints of discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation relating to faculty in violation of this policy can be made to the applicable school dean’s office.\nComplaints can also be made to any of the following:\nThe SHARE Title IX Office at titleix@stanford.edu or 650-497-4955, for concerns regarding sexual harassment\nAnonymously through the Ethics and Compliance Helpline\n(c) Additional Resources\nAdditional resources provide support and assistance to faculty and staff. Discussion of concerns with the following offices will not constitute “notice” to university[1], nor will it create a record of the concerns with the university:\nThe University Ombuds at 650-497-1542,\nThe School of Medicine Ombuds at 650-498-5744,\nThe Faculty Staff Help Center at 650-723-4577, and\nThe Office for Religious & Spiritual Life at (650) 723-1762.\n[1] Unless under limited circumstances. Please see each office’s website for further information about confidentiality.\n5. Investigations\nThe university is committed to promptly and fairly investigating and remediating claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Investigations are conducted as necessary by impartial and qualified personnel and will reach conclusions based on the evidence collected. Unless otherwise required by law, the guideline for investigations to conclude is 90 days; however, this timeline may be extended in some cases, such as complex matters or where there are unforeseen circumstances. Personnel conducting investigations will document and track investigations for reasonable progress and timely closures. If inappropriate conduct or misconduct is found, appropriate corrective and/or disciplinary action will be taken. All individuals covered by this policy are expected to fully and truthfully cooperate in the investigation of any claim of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Failure to cooperate and/or be truthful in an investigation when requested may be grounds for discipline.\nDepending upon an individual's category of employment (e.g., faculty, academic staff, regular staff, postdoctoral scholar, etc.) and the nature of the complaint, applicable grievance or other procedures also may be used to report complaints or to appeal findings of an investigation.\n6. Confidentiality\nThe university recognizes the importance of confidentiality. Personnel responsible for implementing this policy will respect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals reporting or accused of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation to the extent reasonably possible. Examples of situations where confidentiality cannot be maintained include circumstances when the law requires disclosure of information and/or when disclosure by the university is necessary to protect the safety of others.\n7. Protection Against Retaliation\nStanford University policy prohibits retaliation against individuals who raise concerns of perceived discrimination or harassment or who participate in the investigation of any claim of discrimination or harassment. Retaliation is any materially adverse action that would dissuade a reasonable person from making or supporting a claim of harassment or discrimination. Retaliation violates the law and Stanford’s policy. Retaliation can be direct such as changing an employee’s work location, work assignments, pay or schedule, or it can be indirect such as intimidating, threatening, or harassing an employee who has raised a claim or participated as a witness in an investigation. All parties to a concern are prohibited from engaging in intimidating actions directly or indirectly through other persons. \n8. External Reporting\nDiscrimination, harassment, and retaliation is prohibited by state and federal law. In addition to the internal resources described above, individuals may pursue complaints directly with the government agencies that deal with unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation claims, e.g., the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and/or the State of California Civil\nRights Department (CRD). A violation of this policy may exist even where the conduct in question does not violate the law."}

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/privacy-policies/privacy-and-security-health-information","text":"1.6.2 Privacy and Security of Health Information (HIPAA)\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 16.2\nThis Guide Memo describes Stanford University's implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") and its regulations (\"Privacy Rule\" and \"Security Rule\") governing the protection of identifiable health information by health care providers and health plans. The portions of Stanford University that are impacted by HIPAA include the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan, defined in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.\nThis Guide Memo references Stanford University HIPAA Components policies on the University HIPAA website and the Group Health Plan HIPAA policies. The Group Health Plan maintains HIPAA policies and procedures in the Resource Library section of the Benefits website. These policies outline more specific rights of individuals regarding their protected health information (\"PHI\") as well as the operational and system requirements to comply with the Privacy and Security Rules.\nApplicability: This policy applies to all staff, faculty, physicians, volunteers, students, consultants, contractors and subcontractors who are part of the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Stanford University Group Health Plan (\"Group Health Plan\") workforce. Stanford Health Care (\"SHC\"), including Menlo Health Alliance and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (\"LPCH\"), and their respective ERISA health benefit plans have separate HIPAA policies.\n1. The Privacy Rule\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") Privacy Rule limits Stanford University's use and disclosure of information that could potentially associate an individual's identity with their health information. Stanford University may not use or disclose PHI except as authorized by the individual, or as permitted or required by law. Use or disclosure of health information that does not have the potential to reveal an individual's identity is not limited.\n2. The Security Rule\nThe Security Rule requires Stanford University to implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI maintained in an electronic form (\"ePHI\") and to protect ePHI against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards, unauthorized uses or disclosures. The Security Rule protects ePHI stored in University systems during processing and during transmission\n3. Stanford University HIPAA Components Designation\nThe portions of Stanford University that provide health care, or share PHI with those portions, are \"health care components\" and are known collectively as the \"Stanford University HIPAA Components.\" Stanford University has authorized its Privacy Officer to designate the health care components to be included in the Stanford University HIPAA Components. A list of the schools, departments and functions designated as part of the Stanford University HIPAA Components can be found on the Stanford University HIPAA website or requested from the University Privacy Officer. Anyone who believes that their department or program uses or discloses PHI and ought to be designated as part of the Stanford University HIPAA Components should contact the University Privacy Officer.\nIn addition, the Stanford University HIPAA Components have joined Stanford Health Care (\"SHC\"), including Menlo Health Alliance and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford (\"LPCH\") which are together referred to as the \"Hospitals,\" to form a single affiliated entity under the Privacy and Security Rules, known as the Stanford Affiliated Covered Entity. By combining as a single affiliated entity, the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Hospitals have the greatest flexibility to share information with one another to accomplish their missions.\n4. Group Health Plan\nAs an employer, Stanford University sponsors and maintains various ERISA health benefits plans that comprise the Group Health Plan. The Group Health Plan is a separate covered entity from the Stanford University HIPAA Components and, as such, has separate HIPAA privacy and security policies. The list of the plans included in the Group Health Plan can be found on the Stanford University HIPAA website or requested from the University Privacy Officer.\n5. Privacy and Security Information\na. Privacy Officials\nStanford University has designated a HIPAA privacy officer (the \"University Privacy Officer\") for the Stanford University HIPAA Components, the Stanford Affiliated Covered Entity and the Group Health Plan. The University Privacy Officer is responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Privacy Rule. Contact information for the University Privacy Officer is located in Section 13.\nThe University Privacy Officer may request that local privacy officials be designated by a school, department or program included in the Stanford University HIPAA Components or by the Group Health Plan (collectively and individually referred to as \"Program\") as necessary in order to implement the policies within their program effectively. Programs will promptly comply with any such request.\nb. Security Officials\nStanford University has designated a HIPAA security officer (the \"Chief Information Security Officer\") for the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan. The Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for the security of Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan ePHI, including development of the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Security Rule and the implementation of security measures to protect ePHI. Contact information for the Chief Information Security Officer is located in Section 13.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer may designate local security officials (\"delegates\") as necessary to facilitate the implementation of policies, local procedures, and security measures.\n6. Policies and Procedures\nThe University Privacy Officer has developed policies and guidelines designed to keep the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan in compliance with the Privacy Rule. The University Privacy Officer may add or modify policies and guidelines as necessary and appropriate to incorporate changes in the law or to improve the effectiveness of compliance with the Privacy Rule.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer has developed policies and guidelines to comply with the Security Rule and may add or modify those policies and guidelines as necessary and appropriate to improve Security Rule compliance.\nEach of the Stanford University HIPAA Components programs and the Group Health Plan must develop, implement, document, and train its workforce on the procedures necessary to comply with the appropriate HIPAA policies and this Administrative Guide Memo. For information concerning specific program procedures, workforce members should contact the local privacy or security official, as appropriate, or their supervisor.\nPrograms will comply with requests by the University Privacy Officer, the Chief Information Security Officer, the Office of the General Counsel and/or the Internal Audit Department to make written procedures and training materials available for review.\n7. Safeguards\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan will institute reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PHI from any intentional, incidental or unintentional use or disclosure that is in violation of the requirements of HIPAA, the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule or the Stanford University HIPAA policies.\nPlease see the Stanford University HIPAA website for more details.\n8. Training\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan will train members of their respective workforces, including management, on the Stanford University privacy and security policies and Program procedures to the extent necessary or appropriate for the members of the workforce to carry out their functions. New members of the workforce for whom HIPAA training is necessary or appropriate will be trained prior to initial contact with PHI and in no event later than 30 days from the first date of employment. Each member of the workforce whose functions are affected by a material change in the policies or procedures will be trained on those changes in a timely manner, but normally not later than 30 working days from the effective date of the change. Programs will document that workforce training has been completed and will retain these records in the format requested by the University Privacy Officer and Chief Information Security Officer. Training documentation will be provided on request to the University Privacy Officer or the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer will implement a security awareness program to instruct all workforce members on good security practices. The content of the security awareness program will include, but not be limited to information about (a) guarding against, detecting and reporting malicious software, (b) monitoring login attempts and reporting discrepancies, and (c) creating, changing and safeguarding passwords. The program will include periodic updates and reminders on pertinent security measures and issues, including environmental and operational changes affecting the security of ePHI.\n9. Violations\nAnyone who knows or has reason to believe that the Privacy Rule and/or Security Rule, the Stanford University HIPAA policies, the policies contained in this Administrative Guide Memo, or any Program procedure developed to implement these regulations and policies have been violated should report the matter promptly to their supervisor, a local HIPAA official, the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, as appropriate. All reported matters will be investigated in a timely manner and, when possible, will be handled confidentially.\nSee Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving Violations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security.\nIf the workforce member requires anonymity, their may also report such matters to the Institutional Compliance Hotline. If the workforce member does not have internet access, their may contact Institutional Compliance at (650) 721-COMP or 721-2667.\nTo the extent practical, any known harmful effect from a violation of the Privacy Rule or the Security Rule or a security incident will be mitigated. Where appropriate, sanctions will be considered and imposed by the program and/or the University. Programs should document all investigations, resolutions, remedies and sanctions, and forward a copy of such documentation to the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, as appropriate.\n10. Refraining from Intimidating or Retaliatory Attacks\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan will not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any patient, physician, employee, or any other person for exercising their rights, or for participating in any process, established under the Privacy Rule or Security Rule, including submitting a complaint or reporting a violation. Any attempt to retaliate against a person for reporting a violation in accordance with Section 9 above, may itself be considered a violation of this policy and may result in sanctions. An individual who raises concerns about any act or practice allegedly made unlawful by the Privacy Rule or the Security Rule, however, must have a good faith belief that the act or practice is unlawful, and the manner of raising such concerns must be reasonable and not violate the Privacy Rule or Security Rule.\n11. Sanctions\nViolations of the Privacy Rule or Security Rule may, under certain circumstances, result in civil or criminal penalties. Members of the workforce who violate the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, policies contained in this Guide Memo or the Stanford University HIPAA policies, or any program's procedures implementing these policies, may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, contract, or other relationship with the University.\nSee Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving Violations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security.\n12. Evaluation and Reporting\nEach program will provide to the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer all requested information in order that the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer may (a) adequately address complaints, (b) respond to requests from the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or other HHS official, and (c) inform Stanford University or Hospital leadership about compliance with the Privacy and Security Rules.\nStanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan will periodically, and when deemed necessary in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI (e.g., newly identified security risks, newly adopted technologies), conduct a technical and non-technical evaluation of its security safeguards to establish the extent to which its security policies and procedures meet the requirements of the Security Rule, and document its compliance with the Security Rule.\n13. For More Information\nQuestions: If you have questions about these policies, please contact your supervisor. Department management should contact the appropriate program official and/or the University Privacy Officer (with respect to the Privacy Rule) or the Chief Information Security Officer (with respect to the Security Rule) with any questions related to the interpretation of these policies and/or the development of departmental procedures. It is important that all questions be resolved as soon as possible to ensure compliance with the Privacy Rule and Security Rule.\nUniversity Privacy Office, privacy@stanford.edu or call (650) 725-1828\nInformation Security Office, securityofficer@stanford.edu\n14. Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving Violations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security\nOVERVIEW\nStanford University is committed to conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and University policies. The University endeavors to provide a strong infrastructure that promotes a culture committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of patient, medical and research participant information. These guidelines serve a dual purpose. They provide faculty, staff, trainees, students, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and other members of the Stanford community (\"workforce members\") notice of the consequences they will face for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\"), the Health Information Technology Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (\"COMIA\"), or other federal and state laws and regulations governing the confidentiality and security of patient information (\"applicable laws\"), or University policies relating to privacy and security of patient, medical and research participant information.\nSeparately, the guidelines provide University offices (e.g., privacy offices, human resources, academic and student affairs offices) and individual managers direction in determining appropriate consequences for workforce members who violate applicable laws or University policies that safeguard protected health information (\"PHI\") and other patient medical information. These guidelines should be used in conjunction with the corrective action or discipline policy applicable to the relevant workforce member including:\nGuide Memo 1.1.1:Code of Conduct\nGuide Memo 2.1.16: Addressing Conduct and Performance Issues\nCollective Bargaining Agreement between SEIU Local 2007 and Stanford Section 12.7\nFaculty Handbook Chapter 4.3 (Statement on Faculty Discipline)\nThe Fundamental Standard for Students\nMD Program Handbook Chapter 8 (Committee on Performance, Professionalism & Promotion)\nResearch Policy Handbook Chapter 10 (Non Faculty Research Appointments)\nFor definitions pertaining to HIPAA and frequently asked questions relating to HIPAA and other applicable laws relating to the protection of patient health information, see the University's HIPAA website.\nPRINCIPLES\nA. Imposition of Appropriate Sanctions\nWorkforce members will be sanctioned appropriately in the event that they:\naccess, use or disclose more than the minimum PHI necessary to complete their job-related functions;\nfail to adequately protect PHI in accordance with Stanford University's information security policies;\nfail to promptly report a known or suspected HIPAA violation; or\nviolate any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines.\nSanctions may also be imposed for failure to report a known or suspected HIPAA violation or for violating any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines. Sanctions for violations of HIPAA may include, without limitation, counseling, written warning, suspension, and termination. A workforce member's compensation and eligibility to continue in an academic or training program may also be impacted in the event of a violation. These guidelines are not intended to dictate a particular consequence in any particular situation. Rather, in consultation with the appropriate Human Resources and/or Privacy Office, managers, academic affairs and student affairs administrators have the discretion to decide:\nat which level to start the corrective action process based on the severity of the offense, the potential or actual harm to the patient and/or the Hospital(s) or University, and any mitigating factors; and\nwhether immediate termination is justified based on the seriousness of the offense.\nB. Levels of Violations\nThe level of a violation is determined by the severity of the privacy or security breach, whether the breach was intentional or unintentional or motivated by malice or personal gain, and the impact on the patient and/or institution. The following outlines some, but not all, types of violations and categorizes them broadly according to likely severity.\nLevel 1:\nA workforce member carelessly or inadvertently accesses PHI without a job-related need to know, or carelessly or unintentionally reveals PHI to which their has authorized access. Examples of Level 1 violations include, but are not limited to:\nLeaving PHI in a public area in the workplace or disposing of it in the trash instead of shredding receptacles;\nMisdirecting faxes, emails or other documents that contain PHI;\nDiscussing PHI in public areas where the discussion could be overheard;\nOther behaviors reflecting carelessness or lack of judgment in handling PHI.\nLevel 2:\nA workforce member intentionally accesses PHI without authorization or seriously fails to protect PHI. Examples of Level 2 violations include, but are not limited to:\nIntentionally accessing or asking another to access PHI without a job-related need to know, the PHI or a friend, relative, co-worker, public personality or any other individual (including searching for the existence of a record or an address or phone number);\nLeaving paper files and records, computers, laptops, notebooks, smart phones or other devices containing PHI accessible and unattended;\nSharing log-in IDs and passwords with others;\nUsing personal email accounts (e.g., Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo), cloud computing, or other media or storage devices not approved by Stanford University for transmission or storage of PHI or not meeting required security standards (such as encryption, secure email, password protection);\nRemoving PHI from the Stanford University workplace without supervisor approval or failing to appropriately safeguard PHI if removed with supervisor approval or while in transit;\nOther behaviors reflecting intentional conduct or serious failure to safeguard PHI.\nLevel 3:\nA workforce member intentionally accesses, uses or discloses PHI without authorization, often motivated by willful disregard, malice or personal gain. A Level 3 violation is considered serious misconduct. Examples of Level 3 violations include, but are not limited to:\nIntentionally using or disclosing without a job-related need to know the PHI of a friend, relative, co-worker, public personality, or any other individual’s PHI;\nAccessing, using or disclosing PHI for personal purposes or gain, or with an intent to harm the patient or any third party;\nDiscussing or disclosing PHI with any third party either directly or via social networking or blogging sites, such as Twitter and Facebook.\nIntentionally assisting an individual in gaining unauthorized access to PHI.\nJeopardizing the integrity of Stanford University’s systems.\nFailing to cooperate during the investigation of a privacy or security incident.\nFalsifying information during a privacy investigation or reporting in bad faith or for malicious purposes.\nOther behaviors reflecting personal purpose or gain, malice or misconduct.\nC. Considerations in Evaluating Violation for Appropriate Sanctions\nFactors in determining appropriate disciplinary action may include, but are not limited to:\nWhether the breach was intentional or inadvertent;\nThe nature of the breach, including whether the breach involved specially protected information such as HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, or genetic data;\nThe magnitude of the breach, including the number of patients and the volume of protected health information accessed, used or disclosed;\nThe workforce member’s motive in accessing, using or disclosing PHI, and whether there was an element of malice or desire for personal gain; \nWhether the workforce member has committed prior HIPAA violations;\nThe workforce member’s response or conduct during investigation;\nRisk of harm to the victim(s) of the breach or to the University;\nThe existence of any compelling, aggravating or mitigating factors.\nPROCEDURES\nA. Prompt Reporting and Investigation\nEach workforce member must report any alleged, apparent, or potential violations of HIPAA or applicable privacy and security laws promptly (within no more than twenty-four hours) to their supervisor/designee or to the supervisor's supervisor. Suspected violations shall be investigated appropriately and in coordination with the relevant supervisor, Human Resources officer, and the Privacy Officer. Matters involving faculty, students or trainees should also be brought to the attention of the appropriate senior associate dean(s) which may include:\nSenior Associate Deans for Clinical Affairs—for events related to clinical faculty\nSenior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education—for events related to medical students\nSenior Associate Dean for Finance and Administration—for events related to any other individuals to whom this policy applies\nDean, Vice Dean and Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, as applicable—for events related to faculty\nSenior Associate Dean for Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs—for events related to graduate students or postdoctoral scholars\nResults of the investigation and any decision regarding discipline will be documented in writing and disciplinary actions will be made part of the workforce member’s personnel, training or student file. Discipline will be issued in accordance with existing discipline or corrective action policies applicable to the particular workforce member. When faculty members are involved, the Senior Associate Dean shall be consulted, and the faculty member shall have the rights outlined in relevant faculty policies and grievance procedures. The cognizant vice president or dean, or their designee, retains final authority concerning sanctions and will review any sanction involving suspension, dismissal, or termination before it is implemented.\nIn the event of a possible violation of HIPAA or applicable law involving both University and SHC or LPCH personnel, the investigation must be coordinated and any correction actions or sanctions must be consistent between the organizations. Reports to state/federal oversight agencies may be required. In addition to any internal corrective action, employees may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, and referral to applicable licensing boards.\nB. Guidelines for Sanctions\nThe following will serve as guidelines for appropriate sanctions for violations of HIPAA or other applicable laws or policies.\nFaculty\nAppropriate sanctions will be imposed in accordance with the Statement on Faculty Discipline, Faculty Handbook section 4.3.\nEmployees, post-doctoral fellows, volunteers\nLevel 1. Violations shall, in most cases, result in oral or written counseling and/or retraining. Repeat Level 1 violations shall be subject to further disciplinary action up to and including termination.\nLevel 2. Violations shall, in most cases, result in a written disciplinary warning with or without an unpaid suspension, and retraining shall be required. Disciplinary action up to and including termination may be taken for repeat Level 2 violations.\nLevel 3. Violations, in most cases, shall result in immediate termination of employment, academic appointment or ending of a volunteer assignment.\nStudents enrolled in undergraduate or graduate degree programs\nLevel 1: Violations shall, in most cases, result in oral counseling and/or retraining. Repeat Level 1 violations shall be subject to progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination from the program of study.\nLevel 2: Violations shall, in most cases, result a written reprimand in the student’s file and retraining. The student may also be suspended from the program of study.\nLevel 3: Violations, in most cases, shall result in immediate termination from the program of study.\nContractors/Vendors\nViolations of any level shall, in most cases, result in termination of the contract/business relationship and disqualification from future contractual/business relationships."}

Policies That Apply to Special Categories of Information\nStanford has adopted policies governing certain categories of Information. These policies are listed in this section, 2.c. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Administrative Guide Memo 16.1 and any of these special policies, the special policy will control. For more information about Stanford's compliance with any of the laws and policies referenced below, please contact the University Privacy Officer at privacyofficer@stanford.edu or the individual listed in section 4.b as responsible for compliance.\n(1) Prohibited Information, including Social Security Number (\"SSN\") and Drivers License Number (\"DLN\")\nStanford should not use an individual's SSN or DLN as a personal identifier unless required by law or approved by Stanford's Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer or the Data Governance Board. Prohibited information, including SSNs and DLNs, may be stored electronically only in compliance with the Guidelines. If Prohibited Information must be stored on paper, the files must be stored securely with access provided only to authorized persons.\n(2) Student Records\nStudents have rights with respect to access to their education records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (\"FERPA\"). These rights are outlined in the Stanford Bulletin.\n(3) Health Information\nIndividuals have rights with respect to the privacy and security of their health information under Federal and state laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"). These rights are outlined in Guide Memo 1.6.2 and in the University health information privacy policies that can be found at the HIPAA website.\n(4) Human Subjects Research Information\nIn addition to the rights afforded by HIPAA and other laws related to health information, the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (\"Common Rule\") outlines provisions specific to the privacy of research participants and the confidentiality of their information. The Stanford Research Compliance Office maintains the Human Research Protection Program (\"HRPP\") that includes the University policies related specifically to human subjects' research information.\n(5) Financial Services Records\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\") requires that Stanford protect the privacy and security of information collected in the course of providing certain financial services, such as student financial aid or faculty staff housing loans. Stanford has adopted polices to protect this information. These policies are located on the Office of General Counsel's website.\n(6) Information Collected in the Course of Electronic Commerce\nSome areas of the Stanford website operate commercial enterprises online. Stanford also delivers online service through its network. To comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 when Stanford (or any of its partners) collects personally identifiable consumer information on one of the commercial areas of its website or as the operator of an online service, it will conspicuously post either a privacy policy or a link to a privacy policy on the portal page for the commercial activity. This policy will:\nIdentify the categories of personally identifiable information collected through the commercial portions of its website or through its online service;\nIdentify the categories of third-parties with whom Stanford may share that personally identifiable information;\nProvide a description of how an individual may request changes to their personally identifiable information collected through the Web site or online service and retained by Stanford, if any process exists;\nDescribe the process by which Stanford will notify users of the commercial portion of Stanford's website or its online service of material changes to the Stanford's privacy policy for that portion of the website or online service (it is sufficient to say that the policy will be updated online); and\nIdentify the effective date of the privacy policy and all updates.\nd. Confidentiality Agreement\nMembers of the Stanford community are subject to the Confidentiality and Privacy provisions set forth in Section 3 of the Code of Conduct contained in Administrative Guide Memo 1. As a reminder of Stanford's commitment to privacy, students, faculty, staff and other members of the workforce may be asked to sign a confidentiality statement based on the Code of Conduct and this privacy policy. Failure to sign such a statement in no way diminishes the obligation to uphold Stanford's policies.\ne. Training\nDepartments within Stanford University are responsible for ensuring that all members of their workforce (including, among others, faculty, staff, students, consultants and volunteers) receive appropriate training on Stanford's privacy and security policies to the extent necessary and appropriate for them to carry out their required job functions. Departments will maintain adequate records of workforce training, which will be provided upon request by the Office of the General Counsel, the University Privacy Officer, the Chief Information Security Officer, Internal Audit, Human Resources or other University official with a reasonable Stanford-related need for the information.\n3. Expectation of Privacy\na.

Policy Statement\nStanford University strives to provide a place of work and study free of discrimination on the basis of sex, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, and other forms of sexual misconduct. Where such sexual misconduct has occurred, the University will act to stop the misconduct, prevent its recurrence, and discipline and/or take other appropriate action against those responsible. This Guide Memo outlines the University’s definitions and policies relating to sexual misconduct and in compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681) and its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R. 106), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e), the Clery Act (20 U.S.C. 1092(f)) and its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R. 668.46), California Education Code sections 67380, 67383 and 67386, and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1959 (“FEHA”) California Government Code sections 12900 - 12996.[1] This policy also applies to violations of University directives or court orders and acts of intimidation or retaliation relating to the aforementioned conduct or allegations of such conduct.\n2. Policy Violations\nProhibited Sexual Conduct is the umbrella term that Stanford uses under this Policy to collectively define different types of misconduct relating to sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, or exploitation of a sexual nature. Stanford prohibits all forms of Prohibited Sexual Conduct. Stanford is obligated to comply with both state and federal laws with respect to reports of Prohibited Sexual Conduct, when applicable. It is also a violation of this Policy to engage in Retaliation or Intimidation (as those terms are defined below) or to violate a University Directive or Court Order (as those terms are defined below) related to Prohibited Sexual Conduct or allegations of Prohibited Sexual Conduct.\nRegardless of the source of the definition (state, federal, or University), it is a violation of this Policy to commit or attempt to commit any of the acts defined below or to knowingly aid or facilitate another person to commit any act of the acts defined below.\na. Sexual Harassment\nStanford is committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression. Vigorous discussion and debate are fundamental to the University, and this policy is not intended to stifle teaching methods or freedom of expression generally, nor will it be permitted to do so. However, Sexual Harassment is neither legally protected expression nor the proper exercise of academic freedom. It compromises the integrity of the University, its tradition of intellectual freedom, and the trust placed in its members.\nTitle IX Sexual Harassment (applies to all community members)\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681) and its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R. 106) prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, including in the form of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Each of those terms has a special definition within the law. For purposes of this policy, the term “Title IX Sexual Harassment” has the meaning defined directly below. The other forms of sex-based discrimination prohibited by Title IX and its regulations (including forms of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking) are defined separately in this policy.\nTitle IX Sexual Harassment involves conduct, on the basis of sex, that satisfies one or more of the following:\nUnwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, AND objectively offensive that it denies a person equal educational access; OR\nAn employee of the University conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the recipient on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct.\nEmployment-Related Sexual Harassment (applies in employment-related matters)\nEmployment-Related Sexual Harassment is conduct that is outside the scope or jurisdiction of Title IX and, therefore is addressed under the applicable procedure to this form of harassment, as described in Section 8, below. In addition, Employment-Related Sexual Harassment may be conduct that is part of overall conduct that rises to the level of a Title IX Sexual Harassment matter. In such scenarios, the employee would be charged with Title IX Sexual Harassment and the University will concurrently review the matter for a violation of Employment-Related Sexual Harassment. Where conduct constitutes both Title IX Sexual Harassment and Employment-Related Sexual Harassment, the Employment-Related Sexual Harassment will not serve as a basis for additional discipline.\nEmployment-Related Sexual Harassment is conduct, on the basis of sex, that involves one or more of the following:\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute Employment-Related Sexual Harassment when:\nIt is implicitly or explicitly suggested that submission to or rejection of the conduct will be a factor in employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to participate in a University activity; OR\nThe conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating or hostile work environment.\nDetermining what constitutes Employment-Related Sexual Harassment depends on the specific facts and context in which the conduct occurs. Employment-Related Sexual Harassment may take many forms; subtle and indirect or blatant and overt. For example, it may:\nBe conduct toward an individual of the same or different gender, gender expression, gender identity or sexual orientation;\nOccur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship;\nBe aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or it may have the effect of causing an individual to change behavior or work performance; or\nConsist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident if sufficiently egregious.\nWhether the unwanted sexual conduct rises to the level of creating an intimidating or hostile environment is determined using both a subjective standard (that is, a person has been offended by the conduct) and an objective standard (that is, a reasonable person under similar circumstances to the Complainant would find the conduct to be sufficiently severe, persistent OR pervasive so as to interfere with the ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s services, activities, or opportunities).\nUniversity Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students\nFor all student-related matters in a non-employment matter, University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students is conduct that is outside the scope or jurisdiction of Title IX, and therefore is addressed under the applicable procedure to this form of harassment. In addition, University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students may be conduct that is part of overall conduct that rises to the level of a Title IX Sexual Harassment matter. In such scenarios, the student would be charged with Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the University will concurrently review the matter for a violation of University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students. Where conduct violates both Title IX Sexual Harassment and University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students, the violation of University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students will not serve as a basis for additional discipline.\nUniversity Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students is conduct that involves one or more of the following:\nA student in a position of authority in a student organization conditioning the provision of membership, aid, benefit, or service on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; OR\nUnwelcome sexual advances, and other visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic performance or creating an intimidating or hostile academic or student living environment.\nDetermining what constitutes University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students depends on the specific facts and context in which the conduct occurs. University Prohibited Sexual Harassment between Students may take many forms: subtle and indirect or blatant and overt. For example, it may:\nBe conduct toward an individual of the same or different gender, gender expression, gender identity, or sexual orientation;\nOccur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship;\nBe aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or have the effect of causing an individual to change behavior; or\nConsist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident if sufficiently egregious.\nWhether the unwanted sexual conduct rises to the level of creating an intimidating or hostile environment is determined using both a subjective standard (that is, a person has been offended by the conduct) and an objective standard (that is, a reasonable person under similar circumstances to the Complainant would find the conduct to be sufficiently severe, persistent OR pervasive so as to interfere with the ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s services, activities, or opportunities).\nb. Sexual Assault (applies to all community members)\nConsent\nThe following definitions apply to all acts of Sexual Assault described below:\nAffirmative Consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that the person has the Affirmative Consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean Affirmative Consent, nor does silence mean Affirmative Consent. Affirmative Consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. Affirmative Consent may be based on a condition(s), e.g., the use of a condom, and that condition(s) must continue to be met throughout an activity, unless there is mutual agreement to forego or change the condition. When there is no Affirmative Consent present during sexual activity, the activity at issue necessarily occurred “against the person’s will.”\nThe existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of Affirmative Consent.\nIn evaluating Affirmative Consent, it cannot be a defense that a respondent’s belief that the complainant consented to the sexual activity arose under either of the following circumstances:\nThe respondent’s belief in Affirmative Consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the respondent.\nThe respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant gave Affirmative Consent.\nIncapacitation: It shall not be a valid excuse that the respondent believed that the complainant Affirmatively Consented to sexual activity if the respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was Incapacitated. Incapacitation means the complainant was unable to Affirmatively Consent because the complainant was asleep, unconscious, under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, such that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity, or was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition. Incapacitation is not necessarily the same as legal intoxication.\nStranger and Nonstranger Sexual Assault\nThe following definitions apply to all acts of Sexual Assault described below:\nFor the purposes of this Policy, a nonstranger is someone known to the Complainant, whether through a casual meeting or through a longstanding relationship, including a dating or domestic relationship. A stranger is someone unknown to the Complainant at the time of the Sexual Assault.\nCalifornia law requires universities to describe how a school will respond to instances of stranger and non-stranger Sexual Assault: Stanford applies the same policies and sanctions for both stranger and nonstranger Sexual Assault.\nTitle IX & University Sexual Assault\nTitle IX & University Sexual Assault any sexual act[3] directed against a Complainant without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including instances in which the Complainant is incapable of giving consent, including because of Incapacitation.\nTitle IX Nonforcible Sexual Violations\nTitle IX Nonforcible Sexual Violations include the following \nIncest. Nonforcible sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by California law.[4]\nStatutory Intercourse Violation. Nonforcible sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent of California. The age of consent in California is 18.[5]\nUniversity Nonforcible Sexual Violations[6]\nUniversity Nonforcible Sexual Violations include conduct involving one or more of the following:\nInducing Incapacitation. Intentionally causing or attempting to cause the incapacitation of another person for the purpose of rendering that person vulnerable to non-consensual sexual activity, such as through alcohol or drugs.\nRecording/Distributing Sexual Activity.\nRecording, photographing, transmitting, or distributing intimate or sexual images without the knowledge and consent of all parties involved; OR\nViewing such content with the knowledge that all parties did not consent to the transmission, or viewing such content with reckless disregard to whether all parties consented to the transmission.\nc. Relationship Violence (applies to all community members)\nRelationship Violence includes conduct involving one or more of the following:\nDating Violence.[7] Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant. The existence of such a relationship is determined based on the Complainant’s statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\nFor the purposes of this definition:\nDating Violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse.\nDating Violence does not include acts covered under the definition of Domestic Violence\nDomestic Violence.[8] An act that could be classified as a felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed:\nBy a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant;\nBy a person with whom the Complainant shares a child in common;\nBy a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the Complainant as a spouse or intimate partner;\nBy a person similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant under the domestic or family violence laws of California;\nBy any other person against an adult or youth Complainant who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of California.\nTo categorize an incident as Domestic Violence, the relationship between the Respondent and the Complainant must be more than just two people living together as roommates. The people cohabitating must be current or former spouses or have an intimate relationship.\nUniversity Relationship Violence. University Relationship Violence includes verbal or non-verbal communication with the intent to harm another person emotionally, intimidate another person, and/or exert control over another person, of an ongoing and severe nature such that it would cause a reasonable person to experience severe distress, to be fearful for their safety and/or to significantly alter daily routines and activities in order to ensure their safety. University Relationship Violence may occur in a current or former romantic or intimate relationship regardless of the length of the relationship or gender/gender identity of the individuals in the relationship.\nd. Stalking (applies to all community members)[9]\nStalking includes conduct involving the following:\nEngaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to:\nFear for the person’s safety or the safety of others; or\nSuffer substantial emotional distress.\nFor the purposes of this definition:\nCourse of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property.\nReasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the Complainant.\nSubstantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may but does not necessarily require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.\ne. Violation of a University Directive or Court Order (applies to all community members)\nViolation of a University Directive or Court Order includes the following:\nViolation of a University Directive. The failure to comply with a directive issued by the University that restricts the activities of an individual in connection with an allegation or finding of violation under this Policy.\nViolation of a Court Order. The failure to comply with any formal order issued by a state or federal court or authorized police officer that restricts a person’s access to another Stanford community member, such as an emergency, temporary or permanent restraining order.\nf. Retaliation and Intimidation (applies to all community members)\nIt is a violation of this Policy to Intimidate or Retaliate against any person making a complaint or responding to a complaint or against any person participating in the investigation of any such allegation under this Policy (including being the Respondent or participating as a Witness). No person may threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for pursuing or exercising any right or privilege secured by this Policy, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, responded to a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to this Policy.\nRetaliation includes, but is not limited to, adverse action related to employment, academic opportunities, participation in University programs or activities, or similar punitive action. Retaliation can be direct such as changing an employee’s work location, pay or schedule, or for students, changing a grade or denying access to a program, or it can be indirect such as Intimidating, threatening, or harassing an employee or student who has raised a claim or participated as a witness in an investigation.\nIntimidation can be a form of Retaliation, and includes any threatening statement or conduct made with the intent to prevent or dissuade any party or witness from reporting or participating in the process.\nAll parties to a concern and all persons participating in the investigation of a concern are prohibited from engaging in actions intended to Retaliate or Intimidate directly or through support persons.\nCharging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of an investigation does not constitute Retaliation, provided, however, that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a materially false statement in bad faith. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute Retaliation.\n3. Immediate Steps/Emergency Resources/Supportive Measures\nIf you or someone you know has experienced Prohibited Sexual Conduct, here are some immediate steps to consider:\nIf the individual is in immediate danger, or believes there could be an ongoing threat to the individual or the community, please call 911 or 9-911 from a campus phone or use a blue emergency phone tower on campus.\nThe individual that experienced the conduct is encouraged to contact the police, although the individual is not required to make a report to the police. For Prohibited Sexual Conduct that occurs on the Stanford campus, individuals can contact the Stanford Department of Public Safety at (650) 723-9633. For an off-campus incident, individuals can call the local police jurisdiction: Palo Alto, (650) 329-2307; Menlo Park, (650) 325-4424. University officials also will assist individuals in contacting local law enforcement authorities, if the individual requests assistance. If the individual believes that there is an ongoing threat to safety from a particular individual, the individual may request an emergency protective restraining order from a California police officer.\nCalifornia law also provides that individuals who experience sexual violence are encouraged to preserve evidence and to note the identity and location of Witnesses. Contacting law enforcement to make a report allows for forensic evidence to be collected, including a SART exam if needed, which may be helpful if a decision is made to pursue criminal charges. For more information about how to obtain a SART exam, see: https://equity.stanford.edu/sexual-violence-support/urgent-help/forensic-evidence-collection.\nSupportive Measures are available with or without filing a complaint and regardless of whether the university has jurisdiction over an alleged incident. Supportive Measures will be different for every matter and will be based on individualized review. Stanford offers confidential counseling to community members, through the Confidential Support Team for students, and through the Faculty/Staff HELP Center for others. Other Supportive Measures may include extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the Parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus, and other similar measures. The Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE or Deputy Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the effective implementation of Supportive Measures. The Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE or Deputy Title IX Coordinator will consider the Complainant’s wishes with respect to Supportive Measures.\n4. Reporting Prohibited Sexual Conduct or other Policy Violations\nAll reports of Prohibited Sexual Conduct or other violations of this Policy should be reported to the Stanford Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE at Kingscote Gardens, Suite 240, 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, titleix@stanford.edu, (650) 497-4955.\nAny person may report violations of this Policy (whether or not the individual reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of the Policy violation), in person, by mail, by telephone, or by email,[10] using the contact information listed above. Such a report may be made at any time, including during non-business hours, by using the telephone number or email address, or by mail to the office address, listed for the Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE.\nFor reports of violations under this Policy, the following information (if known) should be provided to the SHARE Title IX Office:\nName of Complainant\nComplainant’s role within the university (undergraduate student, graduate student, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, fellow, alumni, other [describe])\nName of Respondent\nRespondent’s role within the university (undergraduate student, graduate student, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, fellow)\nDate of the incident\nLocation of the incident\nTime of the incident\nNature of the conduct (that is, provide specific details of the report)\nDate of previous report (if any)\nTo whom any previous report was made (if any)\nDuty to Report\nExcept for University-recognized Confidential Resources (defined below), the following University staff members with knowledge of unreported concerns relating to violations of this Policy are considered Responsible Employees and are required to promptly report such allegations to the Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE:\nFaculty;\nSupervisors and Managers;\nHuman Resources representatives;\nPrincipal Investigators/Lab Directors or Coordinators;\nStaff within:\nUniversity Human Resources and Employee & Labor Relations;\nResidential Education (including RAs and CAs, acting in their capacities as student staff members);\nVice Provost for Student Affairs;\nVice Provost for Undergraduate Education;\nVice Provost for Graduate Education; and\n(Except the Ombuds) Institutional Equity and Access; and\nStaff who have responsibility for working with students in the following capacities:\nTeaching, including lecturers, instructors, and student instructors/teaching assistants/course assistants acting in their teaching capacities);\nadvising;\ncoaching or mentoring;\ncareer development or internship/externship programs; or\noverseas studies/study abroad.\nThese individuals are required to report the information received to the Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE, regardless of whether the person who is the subject of the Policy violation has or has not indicated they will contact the appropriate office.\nSeparate from the above, notice of a report of Prohibited Sexual Conduct to the following individuals constitutes actual notice triggering the University’s obligations under Title IX:\nTitle IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE\nDeputy Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE\nOther Senior Leaders\nPresident\nProvost\nDeans of Schools\nDirector of Athletics (DAPER)\nVice Presidents\nVice Provosts\nExternal Reports\nCertain Prohibited Sexual Conduct may also violate state and federal law. In addition to the internal resources just described, individuals may pursue complaints directly with the government agencies that deal with unlawful harassment and discrimination claims, e.g., the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education, and the State of California Civil Rights Department (CRD).\nPlease note that a violation of this policy may exist even where the conduct in question does not violate the law.\n5. Privacy and Confidentiality\nFor the purpose of this Policy, Privacy and Confidentiality have distinct meanings.\nPrivacy means that information related to a complaint will be shared with a limited number of University employees who “need to know” in order to assist in the assessment, investigation, and resolution of the report. All employees who are responsible for the University’s response to violations of this Policy receive specific training and guidance about sharing and safeguarding private information in accordance with state and federal law. The privacy of student education records will be protected in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), and the privacy of employee records will be protected in accordance with California law and University policy.\nConfidentiality exists in the context of laws that protect certain relationships, including those who provide services related to medical and clinical care, mental health providers, counselors, and ordained clergy. The law creates a privilege between certain health care providers, mental health care providers, attorneys, clergy, spouses, and others, with their patients, clients, parishioners, and spouses. The University has designated individuals who have the ability to have privileged communications as Confidential Resources.\nThe University will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to preserve an individual’s Privacy and to protect the Confidentiality of information. However, because of laws relating to reporting and other state and federal laws, the University cannot guarantee Confidentiality relating to incidents of Prohibited Sexual Conduct except where those reports are privileged communications to Confidential Resources. Even then, there are exceptions to maintaining Confidentiality set by law; for example, physicians and nurses who treat any physical injury sustained during a sexual assault are required to report it to law enforcement. Also, physicians, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, teachers and social workers must report a sexual assault committed against a person under age 18.[11]\nExcept for Confidential Resources, information shared with other individuals is not legally protected from being disclosed. However, the University takes requests for Privacy and Confidentiality seriously, to the extent it can do so while at the same time fulfilling its responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all students and the University community. The University in such circumstances will make sure the Complainant is aware their/they are protected from Retaliation.\nReports to Law Enforcement and Required Notifications\nAs required by the Clery Act, all disclosures to any University employee of an on-campus or “non-campus property” sexual assault must be reported for statistical purposes only (without personal identifiers) to the Stanford University Department of Public Safety, which has the responsibility for tabulating and annually publishing sexual assault and other crime statistics. To promote public safety, the Department also alerts the campus community to incidents and trends of immediate concern.\nWhen the allegations described could be a crime under California law,[12] University staff members designated as Campus Security Authorities are also required by California law to notify the Stanford University Department of Public Safety. Under California law, violent crimes, including sexual assault, and hate crimes must be reported immediately by calling 9-1-1 or 650-329-2413. Campus security Authorities can report other crimes at https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Report-Form.pdf. (For more information see: https://police.stanford.edu/pdf/CSA-Flowchart.pdf).\nExcept in the event the person who is the subject of the potential criminal act is a minor, the name of this individual should not be released to the Department of Public Safety without the Complainant’s consent.\nIn California, a police officer is required to ask a victim of sexual assault and domestic violence (specifically section 273.5 Penal Code) if they want their name to remain confidential (Penal Code 293(a)). If a victim elects to have their name remain confidential, the police will not list the victim's name in a crime log or release it to University officials without permission (Penal Code 293(d)). If the District Attorney elects to prosecute a sexual assault, the name of an adult victim may be subject to disclosure.\nConsultation/Confidential Resources\nThe University makes available Confidential Resources for consultation regarding reports of violations of this Policy or other conduct, whether or not a Policy violation has actually occurred or the person seeking information is a Complainant, a person who believes their own actions may be the subject of criticism (even if unwarranted), or a third party. Often there is a desire that a consultation be confidential or “off the record.” This can usually be achieved when individuals discuss conduct without identifying the other persons involved, and sometimes even without identifying themselves. However, when a name or details sufficient to identify an individual are provided to a Responsible Employee (defined above), a consultation can no longer be considered “off the record” and then needs to be reported. Confidential Resources, by contrast, are not required to report to or share any information with the University. Confidential Resources do not disclose information received by them with any other office or person, including the SHARE Title IX office, and therefore meeting with a Confidential Resource will never lead to a University response or Investigation. However, Confidentiality does not extend to reasonable belief that a minor (under age 18) has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed, which by law must be reported to law enforcement or child protective services. [13] Similarly, if a client, or a close relation of the client, makes a specific threat of planning to kill or seriously harm another person to a Confidential counselor, this also requires a report to law enforcement. In addition, the University cannot guarantee that conversations with the Ombuds or a dean at the Office for Religious Life at Memorial Church might not be subject to disclosure in legal proceedings or pursuant to other legal process. Communications with attorneys, medical doctors, and mental health care providers, on the other hand, may be privileged under law.\nThe University’s Confidential Resources and Confidential community resources can be found at https://titleix.stanford.edu/confidential-counseling-university-resources.\n6. Required Prevention Education/Training Programs\nFor Faculty, Staff and Postdoctoral Scholars\nIn compliance with California Government Code Section 12950.1, all supervisors (including faculty) who are employed by Stanford are required to participate in a minimum 2-hour sexual harassment training at least every two years. Other topics covered by this program include illegal discrimination, abusive behavior in the workplace, forms of sexual violence, how to be an active “upstander,” supervisor’s responsibility to report and how to appropriately respond to reports of Prohibited Sexual Conduct within the student and staff communities.\nFurther, Stanford requires non-supervisory employees to participate in a minimum 1-hour sexual harassment prevention training at least every two years. All new employees who are not faculty and who do not supervise other workers will be provided Harassment Prevention Training for Non-Supervisory Employees generally within six months of hire. Temporary and casual employees will generally be provided training within 30 calendar days of the date of hire. Participants will learn how to recognize sexual misconduct in the workplace and about campus resources. Other topics covered by this program include illegal discrimination, abusive behavior in the workplace, forms of sexual violence, how to be an active “upstander,” and how to report and appropriately respond to reports of sexual violence or harassment within the student and staff communities.\nFailure to complete assigned prevention education programming/training may result in corrective action.\nFor Students\nStanford requires all incoming students, graduates and undergraduates, to complete prevention education programming prior to enrolling at Stanford, generally through an assigned online course. Additionally, undergraduates are expected to participate in additional programming on campus, or virtually. The university or departments may require additional programming for students, such as student athletes, or students participating in Greek life. Failure to complete assigned prevention education programming can result in an enrollment hold.\nStudent staff and student teaching assistants are required to complete additional training in order to fulfill their student staff or teaching responsibilities. Failure to complete the training can result in termination from the role.\n7. Sanctions\nViolations under this Policy are extremely serious and decision-makers are expected to impose appropriate discipline, University interventions, or remedial or corrective actions for each matter up to and including discharge (for faculty, staff, or other employees), expulsion (for students), removal from campus, and/or other appropriate sanctions or actions. Depending on the circumstances, Respondents may be removed from University programs, placed on administrative leave, and/or removed from campus pending the finding of responsibility for a violation of this Policy.\n8. Procedures for Policy Violations\nThe University has several procedures available to resolve allegations of violations of this Policy. In general, the University will investigate or otherwise respond to reports of violations of this Policy in circumstances in which either:\nBoth the Respondent and the Complainant are subject to this Policy and there is a connection between the allegations and University programs or activities; OR\nThe Respondent is subject to this Policy and investigation and response are necessary for the proper functioning of the University, including the safety of members of the University community or preservation of a respectful and safe climate at the University. \nWhich procedure the University will use to investigate and resolve a violation of this Policy depends on the circumstances of the report, including the respective roles of the Complainant and Respondent at the University, the location of the alleged Policy violation and relationship to University programs or activities, and the severity of the alleged conduct. More information about available procedures can be found at https://titleix.stanford.edu/investigationgrievance-administrative-policy-and-procedures. \nProcedures specific to Employment-Related Sexual Harassment are as follows:\nProcedures for Employment-Related Sexual Harassment\nUniversity Intervention\nDepending on the circumstances and taking into account a Complainant’s request for Confidentiality, a University Intervention in the workplace or academic setting may be attempted. The Intervention may be led by Human Resources professionals, Title IX staff members, the Ombuds, other faculty or staff, or sometimes an outside party unrelated to the University. An Intervention is an action to address a concern without a formal investigation. This process is appropriate when the allegation, if true, would not rise to the level of a Policy violation, but the conduct is nonetheless objectionable. Examples of this conduct could include inappropriate jokes and comments. This process is also appropriate when the Complainant does not want the University to conduct a full investigation and the University considers an intervention an appropriate step to address the concerns. The goal is to address the reported behavior to the extent possible while honoring the wishes of the Complainant.\nIn addition, in the event the person who is the subject of the Policy violation decides not to submit a complaint, the University, consistent with its obligations under California and federal law, reserves the discretion to take prompt, remedial action upon the receipt of notice of a potential Policy violation to cause any harassing behavior to stop. \nInvestigations\nIf significant facts are contested, a prompt investigation may be undertaken. The investigation will be conducted by impartial and trained personnel in a way that respects, to the reasonable extent possible bearing in mind the safety of the campus community, the privacy of all of the persons involved. In appropriate cases, internal or external professional investigators may be asked to conduct or assist in the investigation. In making a finding, the investigator will use the “Preponderance of the Evidence” standard: is it more likely than not that the reported allegations are true. The University will strive to complete investigations as expeditiously as possible. The results of the investigation may be used in the third party intervention process or in a grievance or disciplinary action.\nDisciplinary Procedures, Grievances and/or Appeals\nIn appropriate cases, disciplinary procedures may be initiated. The applicable disciplinary procedure depends on the status of the individual whose conduct is in question (the Respondent).\nDepending upon the nature of the remedial or corrective action imposed, the Respondent may be able to appeal or grieve the disciplinary result. The applicable appeal/grievance procedure depends on the circumstances and the position of the Respondent. Generally, the process consists of the individual's submission of a complaint, a fact-finding process or investigation by a University representative, followed by a decision and, in some cases, the possibility of one or more appeals, usually to Stanford administrative officers at higher levels.\nIndemnification and Costs\nThe question sometimes arises as to whether the University will defend and indemnify a Stanford employee accused of sexual harassment. California law provides, in part, \"An employer shall indemnify [its] employee for all that the employee necessarily expends or loses in direct consequence of the discharge of their duties as such...\" The issue of indemnification depends on the facts and circumstances of each situation. Individuals who violate this policy, however, should be aware that they and/or their schools, institutes, or other units may be required to pay or contribute to any judgments, costs and expenses incurred as a result of behavior that is wrongful and/or contrary to the discharge of the employee's duties. In general, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.4.6.\nRecordkeeping\nThe SHARE Title IX Office will track reports of Employment-Related Sexual Harassment for statistical purposes and report at least annually concerning their number, nature and disposition to the University President through the Provost. University decision-makers have a responsibility to keep the SHARE Title IX Office informed about the outcome of cases.\nThe SHARE Title IX Office may keep confidential records of reports of Employment-Related Sexual Harassment and the actions taken in response to those reports and use them for purposes such as to identify individuals or departments likely to benefit from training so that training priorities can be established.\nPolicy Footnotes\n[1] This Policy is also designed to comply with the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”) (42 U.S.C. 13925) and its implementing regulations (24 C.F.R. 5.2001) if reauthorized.\n[2] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that \"sexual assault\" for purposes of Title IX is defined in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v), which in turn provides that \"[t]he term ‘sexual assault’ means an offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\" The definitions for forcible and nonforcible sex offenses are derived from the FBI’s Summary Reporting System and/or National Incident-Based Reporting System. On August 13, 2020, OCR provided guidance that a university may use definitions from either system, so long as the university includes in its definition of sexual assault all forcible and nonforcible sex offenses described by the FBI—regardless of whether the FBI system uses the label forcible or nonforcible or requires force as an element. Consistent with this guidance, Stanford has elected to use the definitions from each system that provide the most flexibility and that do not use the requirement of force as an element. Stanford has also made slight, non-substantive modifications to the FBI definitions for clarity and consistency with defined terms used within this Policy, such as \"Complainant,\" \"Affirmative Consent,\" and \"Incapacitation.\"\n[3] The following sexual acts covered by this definition are required to be included by federal regulations and are derived from the FBI’s Summary Reporting System and National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual definitions:\nRape. Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant.\nSodomy. Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including instances where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical Incapacitation.\nSexual Assault with an Object. To use an object or instrument to penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including instances where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical Incapacitation.\nFondling. The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification without the Affirmative Consent of the Complainant, including in instances where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical Incapacitation.\n[4] This definition is derived from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual.\n[5] This definition is derived from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual. See also footnote 11 for information regarding reporting requirements for this Policy violation.\n[6] Note that it is possible that some instances of University Nonforcible Sexual Violations might also rise to the level of Title IX Sexual Harassment, such as secretly recording and broadly posting an individual engaged in sexual activity.\n[7] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that “dating violence” for purposes of Title IX is defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10). This definition is derived from that section, with non-substantive modifications for clarity and consistency with this Policy.\n[8] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that “domestic violence” for purposes of Title IX is defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(8). This definition is derived from that section, with non-substantive modifications for clarity and consistency with this Policy.\n[9] Section 106.30(a) of the Title IX regulations provides that “stalking” for purposes of Title IX is defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30). This definition is derived from that section, with non-substantive modifications for clarity and consistency with this Policy.\n[10] Consistent with FEHA, the University does not require a complaint of Prohibited Sexual Conduct to be in writing, but the University’s ability to respond to a complaint that is not in writing may be limited, as provided in the Title IX Procedure.\n[11] University staff members with a duty to report are required to report instances of Statutory Rape under this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator/Director of SHARE only as consistent with California Penal Code sections 11165.1, 11165.9, and 261.5(d), which provide that sexual intercourse between an adult and a minor are only required to be reported when one person is 21 years of age or older and the other person is under 16 years of age.\n[12] Questions about whether conduct could be a crime should be directed to the SHARE Title IX Office or Department of Public Safety.\n[13] Individuals who meet the definition of a mandated reporter under California Penal Code sections 11165.7, 11166, and 11167, must report those incidents of child abuse and neglect as directed by the applicable statute. A person under the age of 18 years of age is a minor subject to these provisions. In addition, physicians and nurses who treat any physical injury sustained during sexual violence are required to report such cases to law enforcement. See also footnote 11 ."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/guiding-policies-and-principles/harassment-discrimination/consensual-sexual-or-romantic","text":"1.7.2 Consensual Sexual or Romantic Relationships In the Workplace and Educational Setting\nThis policy highlights the risks in sexual or romantic relationships in the Stanford workplace or academic setting between individuals in inherently unequal positions; prohibits certain relationships between teachers and students; and requires recusal (from supervision and evaluation) and notification in other relationships.\nApplicability: Applies to all students, faculty, staff, and others who participate in Stanford programs and activities.\n1. In General\nThere are special risks in any sexual or romantic relationship between individuals in inherently unequal positions, and parties in such a relationship assume those risks. In the university context, such positions include (but are not limited to) teacher and student, supervisor and employee, senior faculty and junior faculty, mentor and trainee, adviser and advisee, teaching assistant and student, principal investigator and postdoctoral scholar or research assistant, coach and athlete, attending physician and resident or fellow, and individuals who supervise the day-to-day student living environment and their students.\nBecause of the potential for conflict of interest, exploitation, favoritism, and bias, such relationships may undermine the real or perceived integrity of the supervision and evaluation provided. Further, these relationships are often less consensual than the individual whose position confers power or authority believes. In addition, circumstances may change, and conduct that was previously welcome may become unwelcome. Even when both parties have consented at the outset to a sexual or romantic involvement, this past consent does not remove grounds for a charge based upon subsequent unwelcome conduct.\nSuch relationships may also have unintended, adverse effects on the climate of an academic program or work unit, thereby impairing the learning or working environment for others – both during such a relationship and after any break-up. Relationships in which one party is in a position to evaluate the work or influence the career of the other may provide grounds for complaint by third parties when that relationship gives undue access or advantage, restricts opportunities, or simply creates a perception of these problems. Additionally, even when a relationship ends, there may be bias (even if unintentional) for or against the former partner, or there could be an ongoing impression of such bias; in other words, the effects of a romantic or sexual relationship can extend beyond the relationship itself. \nFor all of these reasons, sexual or romantic relationships--whether regarded as consensual or otherwise--between individuals in inherently unequal positions should in general be avoided and in many circumstances are strictly prohibited by this policy. Since these relationships can occur in multiple contexts on campus, this policy addresses certain contexts specifically. However, the policy covers all sexual and romantic relationships involving individuals in unequal positions, even if not addressed explicitly in what follows.\n2. With Students\nAt a university, the role of the teacher is multifaceted, including serving as intellectual guide, mentor, role model and advisor. This role is at the heart of the University’s educational mission and its integrity must be maintained. The teacher’s influence and authority can extend far beyond the classroom and into the future, affecting the academic progress and careers of our students.\nAccordingly, the University expects teachers to maintain interactions with students free from influences that may interfere with the learning and personal development experiences to which students are entitled. In this context, teachers include those who are entrusted by Stanford to teach, supervise, mentor and coach students, including faculty and consulting faculty of all ranks, lecturers, academic advisors, and principal investigators. The specific policies on teachers outlined below do not apply to Stanford students (undergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral scholars) who may at times take on the role of teachers or teaching assistants, policies for whom are addressed in a separate section.\nAs a general proposition, the University believes that a sexual or romantic relationship between a teacher and a student – even where consensual and whether or not the student is subject to supervision or evaluation by the teacher – is inconsistent with the proper role of the teacher. Not only can these relationships harm the educational environment for the individual student involved, they also undermine the educational environment for other students. Furthermore, such relationships may expose the teacher to charges of misconduct and create a potential liability, not only for the teacher, but also for the University if it is determined that laws against sexual harassment or discrimination have been violated.\nConsequently, the University has established the following parameters regarding sexual or romantic relationships with Stanford students:\nFirst, because of the relative youth of undergraduates and their particular vulnerability in such relationships, sexual or romantic relationships between teachers and undergraduate students are prohibited – regardless of current or future academic or supervisory responsibilities for that student. \nSecond, whenever a teacher has had, or in the future might reasonably be expected to have, academic responsibility over any student, such relationships are prohibited. This includes, for example, any faculty member who teaches in a graduate student’s department, program or division. Conversely, no teacher shall exercise academic responsibility over a student with whom their has previously had a sexual or romantic relationship. “Academic responsibility” includes (but is not limited to) teaching, grading, mentoring, advising on or evaluating research or other academic activity, participating in decisions regarding funding or other resources, clinical supervision, and recommending for admissions, employment, fellowships or awards. In this context, students include graduate and professional school students, postdoctoral scholars, and clinical residents or fellows.\nThird, certain staff roles (including deans and other senior administrators, coaches, supervisors of student employees, Residence Deans and Fellows, as well as others who mentor, advise or have authority over students) also have broad influence on or authority over students and their experience at Stanford. For this reason, sexual or romantic relationships between such staff members and undergraduate students are prohibited. Similarly, relationships between staff members and other students over whom the staff member has had or is likely in the future to have such influence or authority are prohibited.\nWhen a preexisting sexual or romantic relationship between a university employee and a student is prohibited by this policy – or if a relationship not previously prohibited becomes prohibited due to a change in circumstances – the employee must both recuse himself or herself from any supervisory or academic responsibility over the student, and notify their supervisor, department chair or dean about the situation so that adequate alternative supervisory or evaluative arrangements can be put in place. This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well as for current relationships. Failure to disclose the relationship in a timely fashion will itself be considered a violation of policy. The university understands that sexual or romantic relationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent practicable) confidentially.\n3. Between Students (Student Teachers, Teaching Assistants and Graders)\nMany existing policies govern student responsibilities towards each other. The current policy applies when undergraduate or graduate students or post-doctoral scholars are serving in the teaching role as teachers, TAs, graders or research supervisors. The policy does not prohibit students from having consensual sexual or romantic relationships with fellow students. However, if such a relationship exists between a student teacher and a student in a setting for which the student teacher is serving in this capacity, s/he shall not exercise any evaluative or teaching function for that student. Furthermore, the student teacher must recuse himself or herself and notify their supervisor so that alternative evaluative, oversight or teaching arrangements can be put in place. This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well as for current relationships. Failure to notify and recuse in this situation will be subject to discipline under the Fundamental Standard. The university understands that sexual or romantic relationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent practicable) confidentially.\n4. In Other Contexts\nConsensual sexual or romantic relationships between adult employees (including faculty) are not in general prohibited by this policy. However, relationships between employees in which one has direct or indirect authority over the other are always potentially problematic. This includes not only relationships between supervisors and their staff, but also between senior faculty and junior faculty, faculty and both academic and non-academic staff, and so forth.\nWhere such a relationship develops, the person in the position of greater authority or power must recuse him/herself to ensure that their does not exercise any supervisory or evaluative function over the other person in the relationship. Where such recusal is required, the recusing party must also notify their supervisor, department chair, dean or human resources manager, so that person can ensure adequate alternative supervisory or evaluative arrangements are put in place. Such notification is always required where recusal is required. This obligation to recuse and notify exists for past as well as for current relationships. Failure to disclose the relationship in a timely fashion will itself be considered a violation of policy. The university understands that sexual or romantic relationships are often private in nature and the university treats such information sensitively and (to the extent practicable) confidentially.\nThe University has the option to take any action necessary to ensure compliance with the spirit of this policy, including transferring either or both employees to minimize disruption of the work group.\n5. Additional Matters\nIf there is any doubt whether a relationship falls within this policy, individuals should disclose the facts and seek guidance rather than fail to disclose. Questions may be addressed to your supervisor or cognizant dean or to the SHARE Title IX Office, or in confidence to the University Ombuds or the School of Medicine Ombuds. In those rare situations where it is programmatically infeasible to provide alternative supervision, academic responsibility and/or evaluation, the cognizant dean, director or supervisor must approve all (as applicable) academic responsibility, evaluative and compensation actions.Employees who engage in sexual or romantic relationships with a student or other employee contrary to the guidance, prohibitions and requirements provided in the policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal, depending on the nature of and context for the violation. They will also be held accountable for any adverse consequences that result from those relationships.\nStanford’s policy with regard to employment of related persons can be found in the Administrative Guide 2.1.2.2c and is excerpted here:\nEmployment by a related person in any position (e.g. regular staff, faculty, other teaching, temporary, casual, third party, etc.) within an organizational unit can occur only with the approval of the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest administrative person within the organizational unit), or their designee. Under no circumstances may a supervisor hire or approve any compensation action for any employee to whom the supervisor is related. An individual may not supervise, evaluate the job performance, or approve compensation for any individual with whom the supervisor is related.Even when the criteria discussed here are met, employment of a related person in any position within the organization must have the approval of the local human resources office, in addition to the approval of the hiring manager's supervisor, including faculty supervisors. \n6. Policy Review and Evaluation\nThis policy was originally part of the Sexual Harassment policy, which went into effect on October 6, 1993, and was amended November 30, 1995, May 30, 2002, August 30, 2012 and June 11, 2013. Its revision and conversion to a separate policy was made on December 6, 2013 and updated on January 21, 2014. Comments or suggestions should be made to the Provost."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/responsibility-university-funds","text":"3.2.1 Responsibility for University Funds\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36\nThis Guide Memo describes responsibilities for the management of funds in University Projects, Tasks and Awards (PTAs).\n1. Responsibility for University Funds\na. University Officers' Responsibility\nDeans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators, and other University officials are responsible for the management of funds in their PTAs. See Guide Memo 1.2.1: University Organization. These individuals have the authority to expend these funds to accomplish their assigned responsibilities, and are responsible for assuring that expenditures charged to their PTAs are:\nReasonable and necessary\nConsistent with established University policies and practices applicable to the work of the University, including instruction, research, and public service\nConsistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions\nFor more information on cost policy, see Guide Memo 3.1.4: Cost Policy.\nb. Delegation of Authority\nAuthority to sign expenditure documents for the purchase of services and materials on a PTA may be delegated and the University official may authorize the person to whom authority is delegated to further delegate signature authority. The University official retains accountability for prudent control of the PTA. The University official may place limits on the dollar level and the types of expenditures for which signature authority is delegated. For more information on authorization procedures, review and error correction procedures, and expenditures of restricted funds, please see the Financial Authority section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n2. Authorization Procedures\na. Authority and Required Training\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted financial approval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information, see Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford’s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nb. Delegation of Signature Authority\n(1) University Officials\nA letter from University officials indicating the organization for which they are responsible and the administrator to whom they have delegated the ability to manage authority must be on file with Financial Management Services.\n(2) Delegation of Signature Authority\nTo delegate authority for both electronic and paper form transactions, the person responsible for the organization or PTA must delegate such authority via the Authority Manager.\nc. Electronic Signature\nUsers of campus financial systems identify themselves to these systems using approved, secure authentication methods. See Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems, for details on these methods. In addition to these system-independent authentication methods, financial systems may have system-specific authentication methods (e.g., a username and password for a particular system). Regardless of the authentication method, authentication using any of the approved methods is the electronic equivalent of an employee's hand-written signature and may be used as an \"electronic signature\" in electronic applications.\nd. Signature Security\nOnly the person to whom authority is delegated may authorize a transaction either manually or electronically. Disciplinary steps will be taken against individuals who are found to have fraudulently signed the name of another person, used the authentication information of another person, or divulged their authentication information to another person. The possible disciplinary actions for violations, which can include termination of employment or student status, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. User responsibilities for handling authentication information are described in Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems.\ne. Limitations on Signature Authority\n(1) Expense Reimbursement\nNo person may approve their own expense reimbursement, or the expense reimbursement of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly. Expense reimbursements, which require two signatures, must have the signatures of the person incurring the expense and the person responsible for the management of the PTA or a properly delegated agent.\n(2) Independent Review\nBusiness expenses incurred by or on behalf of the President, the Provost, a direct report to the President or the Provost, or the senior financial officer of the academic units must be approved by an independent reviewer designated by the CFO. Expenses for ordinary supplies, customarily available for all employees in an office, should be approved by a local business official and need not be routed for independent review.\n(3) Salaries\nNo person may sign any payroll/personnel form that affects their own salary, or payroll/personnel forms that affect the salary of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly.\n(4) Conflict of Interest\nNo person may authorize payment to any individual or business where there is a conflict of interest. See Guide Memo 1.5.2: Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest.\nf. Revoking Signature Authority\nThe University official who delegated authority (or the person who currently holds that position) is responsible to ensure granted authority reflects the unit's current needs. When a person with signature authority transfers to another department or leaves the University, their authority is automatically revoked. Changes for other operational reasons can be made at any time through the Authority Manager. For more information, see Quick Steps: Grant, Change, Revoke or Restore Financial Authority to Others on the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n3. Review and Error Correction\na. Departmental Review\nThe deans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators and other University officials to whom funds are allocated are responsible for reviewing their expense transactions and monthly expenditure/operating statements to assure that:\nAny expenditure is necessary and for University purposes.\nCharges are correct.\nCharges are allowable for the PTA.\nCharges are correctly coded as allowable or unallowable for inclusion in the University's indirect cost rate calculations.\nCharges are allocable to the PTA (i.e., necessary to achieve objectives of the project).\nAny allocation of costs is reasonable and equitable.\nCharges are appropriately documented, and are recorded in a consistent manner within departmental accounts.\nb. Evidence of Review\nReview of transactions is evidenced by a manual or electronic signature in the appropriate field of the form.\nc. Responsibility for Error Correction\nThe department is responsible for correction of errors. Time limits for error correction are outlined in Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.3, Cost Sharing Policy. Occasionally errors are found after the regular time limits for correction. Regardless of when the error is found, the University officer whose PTA used the good or service must pay for it, either from the same or another appropriate PTA.\nd. Central Office Review\nTo supplement (but not replace) the University official's basic review responsibility, Financial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Office of Sponsored Research review University selected expense transactions. If incorrect or improper charges are found, the reviewing office directs the person responsible for the expenditures to correct the error. If necessary, the reviewing office may correct the department's error and will provide the department with a copy of the accounting entry.\n4. Expenditures of Restricted Funds\na. Conformity to External Restrictions — Sponsored Research\nExpenditures of restricted funds, such as organized research or gift funds, whether from federal or non-federal sources, must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the agreement (e.g., grant or cooperative agreement). Expenditures of funds for federally sponsored projects are subject to the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness standards of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR 200, Uniform Guidance), and the negotiated agreements between the University and the federal government. Please see the DoResearch website for more information: http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing Cost-sharing tasks are subject to the same standards as the sponsored project that they support.\nb. Monthly Review of Charges\nFor sponsored projects and related cost-sharing tasks, the expenditure statements must be reviewed each month, as noted in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTA). The review should include areas such as those covered by the Monthly Review Guidance and Monthly Reconciliation tools. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure statement. The review must be completed within two months of the end of the month of the statement (e.g., October expenditures must be reviewed no later than December 31). Principal Investigators may delegate monthly review of expenditures, but may not delegate the Quarterly Certification of Charges (see paragraph 4.c).\nc. Quarterly Certification of Charges\nThe following certification of direct costs is preprinted on expenditure statements for sponsored projects and cost-sharing tasks each month:\n\"I have reviewed the three months of expenditures for this quarter. To the best of my knowledge, all expenditures are appropriate. Where required, corrections have been or will be made through the accounting system. I understand that to be considered timely all corrections must be made within two months of the last day of month being reviewed.\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR'S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________ \nPROJECT TASK MANAGER’S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________\"\nQuarterly certification is the responsibility of the project Principal Investigator (or Co-PI). A PI may delegate the monthly review of statements for accuracy, but may not delegate certification of the appropriateness of the charges. This certification statement must be signed by the principal investigator and the project task manager. Only the last expenditure statement for the academic quarter must be signed by the principal investigator and Project Task Manager. The quarterly certification must be completed within two months of the end of the academic quarter being certified, as described in the Monthly Review and Quarterly PI Review Certification. This signature means that the principal investigator has reviewed all direct charges to the project and that either the charges on the expenditure statement are reasonably accurate as shown, or that the appropriate individual in the department has initiated accounting entries to correct any differences. Review and correction of differences must be completed within the deadlines outlined on the DoResearch site.\nd. Record Retention\nThe certified expenditure statements must be retained in the department files for future review by government and University auditors in accordance with University record retention requirements for sponsored projects (see Guide Memo 3.1.5: Retention of Financial Records.\n5. Expenditures of Gifts\na. Conformity to Donor Restrictions — Gifts\nGifts, which typically differ from sponsored projects in that they do not require a detailed scope of work, budget, or period of performance, may on occasion have restrictions on the use of funds (to ensure the use is consistent with the donor’s original, accepted, stipulations). If this is the case, the University must take care to allocate the funds to the academic area, group, department, faculty member or other University activity as stipulated. While the academic area or faculty member may have broad discretion over the specific expenditures of support, the donor may expect a report on the general uses of funds donated or even a report on line-item expenses. Donors do not typically recoup gift funds, but if a gift made for a restricted purpose has not, however, been spent according to the donor’s restrictions, a donor may have grounds to rescind and recoup the gifted funds.\nb. Gifts to Stanford made by Faculty, Staff, Spouse or Family member\nTo ensure compliance with regulations governing charitable contributions and to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, gifts made to Stanford by Stanford faculty, staff, spouse or family member: \nShould be placed in a unique account so that the source and use of the gifted funds can be clearly identified.\nMay not be placed in accounts under the control of the donor (e.g. neither the donor, nor any individual reporting to the donor, may have signature authority over the account).\nMay not be used to fund travel, purchases, or any other expense that could be construed by others to benefit the donor for purposes unrelated to their work for the University.\nMay not be used to fund the salary of the donor.\n6. Sources for More Information\nCognizant Office\nFinancial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Research Financial Compliance and Services (RFCS) office are available to answer questions about expenditure authorization. For contact information, see the Gateway to Financial Activities website or the DoResearch website."}

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/receiving-and-processing-gifts/receiving-and-processing-gifts","text":"4.2.1 Receiving and Processing Gifts\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 42\nThis Guide Memo describes the various types of gifts accepted by Stanford University and the procedures for handling them.\n1. General Procedures\na. Prompt Delivery of Gifts\nAll gifts arriving at or transferred to any part of the university should be initiated in the Gift Transmittal system by a trained user, and then be sent on the same day the gift is received to the Development Services department in the Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018. Alternately, gifts may be sent to the local development offices in the schools and departments across campus. Gifts to the School of Medicine should always be sent directly to Medical Center Development. Gifts should never be sent to the Controller's Office, Fund Accounting, or the Cashier's Office.\nFor gifts of equipment, see Guide Memo 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment.\nb. Required Documentation\nIn all cases, the university unit that has received the gift must follow these steps:\nScan all original correspondence pertaining to a gift, including the envelope and/or shipping label. The postmarked envelope will ensure the proper gift date is verified and recorded by Development Services.\nInitiate a Gift Transmittal. An authorized Gift User may go to the system and login using SUNet ID and password. Instructions are available on the Fingate website.\nComplete the Gift Transmittal form as appropriate. Instructions for authorized users are on the Fingate website.The office forwarding the gift can save the scanned documents for their records through the fiscal year, but please note that this is optional and that once posted to PostGrads, documents should be deleted from local files.\nAny questions should be directed to Development Services, (650) 725-4360 or secure-development-services@lists.stanford.edu.\nc. Donor Record Files\nThe Office of Development maintains complete donor records, including all university alumni and friends, as well as corporations and foundations that support the university. Original donor correspondence and copies of all university correspondence pertaining to gifts should be sent to the Office of Development, Development Services. The Office of Development will forward gift documents to the Fund Accounting section of the Controller's Office as appropriate.\n2. Types of Gifts\na. Cash\nDo not send cash through interdepartmental or other mail service. Call Development Services (650) 725-4360 for instructions.\nb. Checks\nChecks should be forwarded to Development Services (326 Galvez Street, mail code: 5018) immediately for prompt deposit after initiating the Gift Transmittal (see above). Holding checks results in lost interest earnings for the university and, if not cashed in a reasonable amount of time, may eventually result in invalidation. All checks $5,000 or more should be hand-carried to the Arrillaga Alumni Center or put in a secure lockbox on the Edwards building or on the Memorial Drive side of the Alumni Center for courier pick-up.\nc. Securities\nStock certificates received by a school or department should be forwarded to the Gift Securities team immediately for prompt processing. If stock certificates are received in the mail the postmarked envelope must be included so that the Gift Securities team can determine the correct date for valuing the shares and dating the gift receipt. If stock certificates are received via private courier (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, DHL), the department must include a memo stating when the envelope was received in the department. The university will, in almost all cases, sell the securities through its brokers after they are received.\n(1) Delivery of Securities\nThe transfer of securities to Stanford may be accomplished in several ways:\n(i) Broker-to-Broker Transfer: \nDonors should instruct their broker to transfer securities intended for Stanford to the university by contacting the Gift Securities team in the Controller’s Office (ph # 650-721-1917, fax # 650-721-2417, email: stockgifts@stanford.edu), who will provide instructions for the donor’s broker to initiate the gift transfer. A copy of any gift transmittal letter or other related correspondence should be sent immediately to the Gift Securities team.\n(ii) Mail:\nEndorsed certificates naming Stanford University (or the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University) as transferee may be sent by regular mail (certified mail recommended) to:\nBy USPS or Courier (FedEx, UPS, or other overnight delivery): Stanford University-Gift Securities Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center\nc/o Development Services – Attn: Gift Securities\n326 Galvez Street\nStanford University\nStanford, CA 94305-6105\n(iii) Hand Delivery:\nEndorsed certificates naming Stanford University (or the Board...) as transferee may be delivered by hand to any of the following locations:\nOffice of Development\nFrances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center\nc/o Development Services – Attn: Gift Securities\n326 Galvez Street\nStanford University\nStanford, California 94305-6105\nAlso:\nStanford University – Gift Securities \nStanford Redwood City Campus \n485 Broadway – University Hall (U250.12) \nRedwood City, CA 94063\n(2) Certificate in Excess of Gift\nIf a donor's stock certificate represents a greater number of shares than the number of shares the donor intends to gift to the university, then please contact the Gift Securities team for further instructions. This transaction requires special handling and several documents to permit Stanford’s brokerage firm to manage the transfer and re-registration of the shares not intended as the gift. \nGift Securities team \nEmail: stockgifts@stanford.edu \nPhone: 650-721-1917\nFax: 650-721-2417\nd. Credit Cards\nDonors may charge gifts to their Mastercard, Visa, Discover Card or American Express credit cards by indicating in writing the amount of the gift, their credit card number, the date of its expiration, and their signature (as the name appears on the credit card). If a Stanford employee receives credit card information intended for a gift, they should send it to Development Services via the Office of Development courier service, fax it via the secure fax number (650) 725-0200, put the information in the one of the two gift drop boxes on campus (located at the Alumni Center and the Edwards building) or hand-carry it to the Alumni Center. Donors or staff may also call Development Services at (650) 725-4360 to make a credit card gift. DO NOT email credit card information or send it via campus mail as both of these options have serious potential for security risks.\ne. Electronic Transfers\nDonors may make gifts to the university through three types of electronic transfer.\n(1) Wire Transfer\nA donor who wishes to make a gift via wire transfer into a Stanford account must contact Development Services to obtain current instructions and to make sure the appropriate university personnel are alerted to the transaction. Instructions for wire transfers can be found here: https://giving.stanford.edu/how-to-make-a-gift/transfers/wire/\n(2) Payroll Deduction\nStanford employees may authorize a set amount to be deducted from their paychecks as a gift to Stanford. To arrange for payroll deduction gifts Stanford employees should contact Development Services, which will make arrangements with the Payroll Department. Employees wishing to change, renew, or cancel payroll deduction gifts should send a written request to Development Services.\n(3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or Direct Deposit\nDonors may authorize a set amount to be automatically withdrawn from their checking or savings accounts as a gift to Stanford. To arrange for EFT gifts donors should contact Development Services. Instructions for EFT gifts can be found here: https://giving.stanford.edu/how-to-make-a-gift/transfers/ach/ \nf. Memorial and Honorarium Gifts\nIn most cases, the university uses memorial gifts (i.e., contributions made in memory of someone who has passed away) to support the objects and purposes of the university; honorarium gifts made in honor of a special event or living person are handled in the same way. If an alternative purpose is preferred, a separate memorial or named fund may be established through the Office of Development.\ng. Gifts of Real or Personal Property\nIf a gift of real estate or an item of personal property is offered to Stanford it is important that the proper university department or official determine whether the university is able to accept it. Such decisions are made according to established university policies and guidelines according to the type of gift.\n(1) Real Estate Gifts\nThe Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, and the Director of Gift Real Estate in the Real Estate department within Land, Buildings & Real Estate should be notified of a donor's intent to make a gift of real property to the university. The Director of Gift Real Estate must first inspect the property and determine that the property may be accepted by the university. The staff in the Office of Planned Giving will then obtain any necessary Board of Trustees approval, draft requisite documents, make arrangements for title to be transferred to the university and for the gift to be credited in Development Services, and work with the donor regarding the Internal Revenue Service Form 8283. The staff in the Office of Planned Giving is available to respond to donors’ tax and other related questions.\n(2) Gifts in Kind (Tangible Personal Property)\n(i) Categories\nEquipment: See Guide Memo 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment.\nArtifacts, specimens, and historical objects for departmental special collections: see Guide Memo 4.2.4: Departmental Special Collections.\nGifts of Personal Property for Resale: Gifts of personal property intended for resale should not be accepted unless it is determined that the item is appropriate for the University to resell. Examples include gifts made for the Committee for Art's Treasure Market or for a rummage sale to benefit a particular department or project. Questions about the salability of items not earmarked for a specific sales event may be directed to the Property Management Office.\n(ii) Prior Consultation\nThe Office of Planned Giving should be contacted prior to accepting gifts in kind to make sure that the donor has been apprised of tax deductibility and IRS substantiation requirements, and to assist in drafting any agreements with the donor relating to the gift. Development Services must then be notified in order for the donor to obtain a gift receipt unless previously arranged procedures have been established for the unit (e.g., University Libraries, Treasure Market) to issue its own receipt.\n(iii) Delivery Arrangements\nGifts in kind that Stanford plans to keep and use are usually delivered directly to the relevant school, department, laboratory, library, or museum that has previously approved the item's acceptance and is where the item will be housed. Preliminary arrangements may also include agreements regarding costs of packing and freight charges, which are usually the responsibility of the donor.\n(iv) Recording\nExcept for donated capital equipment, gifts in kind are not normally recorded in the donor's gift record nor in the University's accounting system; contact the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, for information about exceptions for crediting gifts in kind to a donor's record.\nh. Special Types of Gifts\n(1) Life Income Gifts\nDonors may arrange to make a gift to Stanford that will pay them and/or a designated beneficiary an income for life or for a term of years. After the death of the last beneficiary or expiration of the term of years, the gift remainder is used by the university as specified by the donor. Contact the Office of Planned Giving for further information and/or to arrange for a consultation with a donor and their advisor(s).\n(2) Bargain Sales\nUnder some circumstances, the university may provide some cash consideration below market value to a donor in exchange for a gift of real or personal property. Offers to sell art objects, equipment, securities, real estate, etc. to Stanford at a substantially discounted price should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving. The amount of the gift recorded by Development Services will be the difference between the fair market value and the discounted price.\n(3) Life Insurance\nDonors may make life insurance gifts in a number of ways:\nby naming the university as the beneficiary of the policy;\nby transferring ownership of a paid-up policy to the university;\nby transferring ownership of a policy to the university and making periodic gifts to the university to cover payment of the policy premiums. Stanford does not make premium payments from sources other than gifts intended for such purposes. The tax ramifications of life insurance gifts are complicated; questions should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving.\n(4) Bequests\nSince its founding, Stanford has derived significant and ongoing support from bequest gifts. Names of donors who have confirmed that a bequest for Stanford is included in their will or trust should be forwarded to the Office of Planned Giving along with any known details of the gift. The Office of Planned Giving operates The Founding Grant Society, which recognizes and honors those who have made life income gifts or who have indicated that a bequest to the University is included in their estate plans. Staff counsel in the Office of Planned Giving are available to consult with donors and their advisors in the drafting of bequests to the University. Information about or questions concerning any bequest gift that has matured should be immediately referred to the Manager of Trusts and Bequests in the Office of Planned Giving (650/725‑4358).\n(5) Matching Programs\nThis section does not pertain to Corporate Matching Gifts, which are addressed below in subsection (6).\nAn important consideration with matching programs is our ability to steward gifts that provide and receive matching by ensuring that the process works correctly and in a timely manner. The administrative effort involved is significant, and we want to be certain that existing and new programs are structured in a way that can be implemented effectively. Consult with the Office of Development Finance Department if you are considering a new matching program or think a fund should qualify for some sort of match. The Finance team needs to understand the desired ratios and timing and can help to structure the program.\nMatching funds should be separated and only used for matching purposes. Please be aware that with existing matching automation, when the matching source is an endowment fund, transfers can only take place from endowment principal.\nAll new matching programs must be approved by the Vice President for Development, so please be sure you have approval before committing to a matching program with a donor.\n(6) Corporate Matching Gifts\nDonors or their spouses may work for, serve on the board of, or be retired from, a company that will match their gifts to Stanford. Donors should follow their company's procedures, which usually involve filling out a form and sending it to Stanford with their gift. Departments or other units that receive any corporate matching forms MUST forward the forms to Development Services in the Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018, and should NOT sign the forms themselves or return them to the company. Only Development Services is authorized to verify to a company that a gift qualifies for matching funds.\n3. Year-end Gifts\na. Tax-Year End\nDuring the month of December the volume of gifts to be processed increases sharply. Departments or other units receiving gifts during this very busy time of year should expedite delivery of gifts to Development Services and should take steps (described below) to verify the date of the gift so that the receipt issued by Development Services to the donor will reflect the proper date for the donor's tax purposes. The gift receipt will bear a December date even when the gift is processed in January if the gift is received in Development Services on or before December 31 or if the date is verified in one of the following ways:\n(1) Hand Delivery\nGifts may be delivered to any Stanford representative on or before December 31 in order to be treated as a gift made during that tax year. The Stanford representative should provide the donor with a signed and dated memo acknowledging receipt for securities or cash, keeping a copy to send to Development Services, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018, with the gift. In addition, the Stanford representative should sign or initial a notation of the date the gift was delivered directly on the check, or on the remit or any correspondence accompanying the gift.\n(2) Postmarks\nThe date of receipt for gifts received by mail is the postmark date that appears on the envelope. Therefore during December and early January it is especially important to include the postmarked envelope along with the gift when forwarding it to Development Services.\n(3) Transfers\nBroker to broker transfers of securities and wire transfers of cash must be completed and the transferred property must be in Stanford's account by December 31 to count as a gift for that tax year.\nb. Fiscal Year-End\nThe university fiscal year ends August 31. To be reflected in the university's record for a given fiscal year, gifts must be received in Development Services by 2:00 p.m. on the last working day of the fiscal year. Gifts processed later, even if dated before August 31, will be entered in the University's records in the following fiscal year. After the end of the fiscal year, requests for corrections to gift records should be made to Development Services at secure-development-services@lists.stanford.edu, who will in turn coordinate the necessary journal entries with Fund Accounting."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/purchasing-and-payments/purchasing-policies/procurement-policies","text":"5.1.1 Procurement Policies | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 51\nThis Guide Memo serves as an introduction to Chapter 5. It covers general policies for the purchase of major and minor construction, equipment, supplies and services by Stanford. The policies in this chapter do not apply to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).\n1. Authority to Commit University Funds\nThe Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, which has responsibility for all University funds, including those received under grants and contracts and those originating with other outside sources, has delegated authority for the acquisition and disposition of property and the expenditure of University monies to various University officers and officials (see Guide Memo 3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures).\na. Department Administrators\nDepartment administrators in Schools and Departments have the authority to approve the commitment and expenditure of funds for a given purpose and against specific accounts for which they have been officially delegated authority (see Guide Memo 3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures). For the purposes of this Guide Memo, this action usually takes the form of a Purchase Requisition.\nb. Procurement\nProcurement, part of Stanford's Financial Management Services organization, is authorized to execute contracts and place orders for goods and services, subject to the receipt of an approved Purchase Requisition (see [1.a.] above). With the exception of certain delegations, Procurement is the sole holder of this authority at the University.\nc. Purchases by University Departments\nProcurement has delegated authority to departments to approve the acquisition of goods or services when the total dollar value of the transaction is less than $25,000 per transaction and does not require a contract or is less than $5,000 on a Purchasing Card transaction. (See Guide Memo 5.3.3: Purchasing Cards.)\nd. Unauthorized Purchases\nNo person not authorized in writing by Stanford may commit Stanford funds to purchase goods or services. If an unauthorized person attempts to commit University funds, Stanford may consider the acquisition effort null and void and decline to pay any invoice that might be issued. Stanford officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Procurement Officer, and those to whom the Chief Procurement Officer has delegated authority, including operations managers, supervisors and buyers, may refuse to ratify such transactions. In such a case, the supplier may look to the individual placing the order for payment or reimbursement.\nPurchases made without an approved Oracle purchase order number will be flagged and Procurement will contact the requestor for review. Further non-compliance will result in written notice to requester, approver, and the appropriate school or department financial manager. A third instance of non-compliance will result in written notice to the Head of the Administrative Department or the Senior Associate Dean of Finance and Academic Dean of the School, and may result in suspension of Oracle privileges and Purchasing Card use.\ne. Personal Expenses\nPersonal expenses and purchases that are not made on behalf of the University or for use by the University are not permitted. These may be considered fraudulent transactions. Purchases must be for the use and benefit of Stanford University, regardless of intent to reimburse Stanford. If any Stanford user associated with the purchase commits purposeful fraudulent or other inappropriate behavior regarding the proper use of the requisitioning and purchasing process, it will be considered serious misconduct and will result in disciplinary action.\n2. Competition\nThe University's policy is that acquisition of products or services will be by competition between potential suppliers, to the maximum practical extent subject to the requirements of quality, price and performance. Attestation of price reasonableness should be acquired prior to submitting any requisition for approval. This is the responsibility of the requestor. Therefore, individuals that request goods and services are responsible for attaining and documenting their efforts related to purchases requests. Requestors may elect to do one or more of the following to ensure and/or document price reasonableness:\nSolicit competitive bids\nCompare pricing across suppliers\nDocument justification for a single source or sole source (a single source is a supplier specifically selected amongst others, due to superior compatibility, quality, service, support, continuity, etc.; a sole source supplies a product or service for which there is no alternative supplier). The source justification should include the following information: \nA specific description of the supplies or services required to meet the needs, and a statement of facts that show the unique qualifications of the services or items selected to satisfy those needs.\nA description of efforts made to locate other sources of supply.\nDocumentation that the anticipated cost is fair and reasonable. This can be a comparison of prices when the item is generally available or, when the item is to be specially fabricated, an analysis of the manufacturer's cost.\nAny other information supporting the use of other than full and open competition.\n3. Conflict of Interest or Ethics\na. Policies\nAll procurement activities must conform to the University Code of Conduct (Guide Memo 1.1.1), Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest (Guide Memo 1.5.2), and Faculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest (Research Policy Handbook 4.1). Any known or apparent violation of these policies, whether by an employee or a supplier, must be immediately reported as directed in these policies.\nb. Personal Purchases\nProcurement does not arrange personal purchases for Stanford faculty, staff or students. The Buyer can render assistance to such individuals only by informing callers of the names of known suppliers. The buyer will spend no time locating suppliers or securing quotations. Similarly, a department may not place an order for an individual employee or student and then have that person reimburse the department.\n4. On-Campus Sources of Goods and Services\nStanford provides many goods and services on campus for less than an individual order placed off-campus would cost. A department needing a product or service provided by a Stanford source should order from a Stanford organization that provides it. If Procurement receives a requisition from a department for an item available at Stanford, the buyer may forward the requisition to the appropriate Stanford organization or require the department to place an order that can be processed without the assistance of a buyer.\n5. Purchases on Government Grants and Contracts\nStanford University receives many government grants and contracts for academic research. In carrying out its sponsored projects, Stanford fulfills the agreement's conditions, some of which are stated in the sponsored project agreement, others in statutes, regulations and policy statements.\na. Terms and Conditions\nA grant or contract often requires Stanford to include certain contractual clauses in purchase orders or subcontracts issued under the award. Procurement determines which contractual clauses are appropriate for inclusion in individual contracts. Purchase orders should be placed through the Procurement department to ensure compliance with Stanford's purchasing policies and legal requirements.\nb. Prior Approval\nIf a government sponsored project agreement is a funding source, a government representative may be required to approve a proposed purchase of capital equipment or complex goods or services before the buyer places the order. See the Property Administration Manual for prior approval procedures.\n(1) Offices Needing Documentation\nThe requesting department is responsible for maintaining records of approval documentation. When required, Purchasing or Accounts Payable may request copies of such documents.\n(2) Subcontracts\nIf the purchase requires government approval of subcontract provisions, the buyer will obtain necessary approval and keep it in the Procurement Office files.\nc. Pre-Acquisition Screening\nThe U.S. Government Office of Management and Budget Circular A-110 and other government regulations that cover the administration of agreements with federal government agencies require that Stanford screen the existing inventory of capital equipment for availability before ordering capital equipment to avoid purchasing \"unnecessary or duplicative items.\"\n(1) Screening Levels\nThe department making the purchase must screen for items of equipment costing between $5,000 and $24,999 at the departmental level before purchase, and items at $25,000 and above at the University level. Equipment costing less than $5,000 need not be screened.\n(2) Loans and Transfers\nGovernment policy encourages loans or transfers of equipment from other government projects.\n(3) Where to Get Help\nFor information on screening procedures, see the Property Administration Manual.\n6. Government-Required Licenses and Permits\nCertain transactions require permits or licenses from the federal government. Stanford's customs broker and preferred vendor for outside logistics services provide consultation and assistance as necessary. Procurement will provide contact information for current vendors on request. The permits or licenses most frequently required to transact business are:\na. Agriculture Permits\nThe Department of Agriculture issues permits for import of certain organisms and biological vectors. The requesting department is responsible for obtaining a permit for each shipment or group of related shipments. The form required by the USDA is VS 16-3.\nb. Import or Export Licenses\nThe Department of Commerce or the U.S. Department of State issues licenses for either export or the importation of equipment or technical data. The requesting department is responsible for obtaining and/or signing the required license.\nc. Duty Free Entry of Scientific Equipment\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce may exempt payment of import duties for scientific equipment. Each department requesting such exemption is responsible for filling out the appropriate paperwork. The form required is ITA-338P.\nd. Radioactive Materials\nA requisition for radioactive materials must contain a Controlled Radiation Authorization (CRA) number (obtainable from Health Physics) before Purchasing processes the order.\n7. Shipping of Biological and Hazardous Materials\nThe United States Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration enforce strict and detailed regulations to assure the safety of aircraft and other modes of transportation for hazardous materials or \"Dangerous Goods.\" Dangerous Goods include, but are not limited to those that are flammable, combustible, corrosive, reactive, oxidizing, toxic, radioactive, infectious, elevated in temperature, highly magnetic, or compressed gasses. Aerosol cans and Dry Ice are also regulated. Violations may result in monetary penalties.\na. Training\nThe person(s) packing the material and/or signing the shipping papers must be trained and certified in the shipping of Dangerous Goods. The training and certification must be repeated within every two year period.\nb. Where to Get Help\nThe Environmental, Health and Safety Department offers training and has a certified shipper on staff. EH&S personnel are available and ready to help prepare any Dangerous Good for shipment. For web-based information, see Shipping of Hazardous Materials."}

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-policies/university-payroll","text":"2.2.3 University Payroll | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 35\nThis Guide Memo contains general policies concerning the university payroll. SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) currently applies the applicable policies contained herein. SLAC departments should consult SLAC Business Services Division for SLAC procedures.\n1. Employer/Employee Relationship\nWhether an individual is a university employee or an independent contractor is a determination with important practical and legal consequences.\na. Definitions of Employee and Independent Contractor/Consultant\nFederal tax rules define an employee as an individual who performs services subject to control by an employer both as to what services shall be performed and how they shall be performed. If the university has the legal right to control both the method and result of services, that person is considered an employee and therefore subject to income tax withholding. By contrast, for independent contractors (sometimes called consultants), the university does not control where and how the work is performed but only receives a final deliverable. Independent contractors or consulting firms should be procured through the procurement contract process on the Fingate website. For more information, refer to IRS guidance at Employee or Independent Contractor Status. If the person and/or work being performed do not legally qualify for Independent Contractor status, hiring the person as a contingent worker may be the appropriate option.\n2. Employment Categories\nEmployees are categorized within the payroll system according to the length of the appointment, the percentage of time worked, and the type of position they fill. These categories in combination affect eligibility for most employment benefits.\na. Length of Appointment\n(1) Continuing\nContinuing employees are expected to remain on the payroll for six months or more (four months or more for Bargaining Unit employees).\n(2) Temporary\nTemporary employees are expected to remain on the payroll for less than six months (less than four months for Bargaining Unit employees). Stanford students working less than 50% time may be appointed for the entire academic year as temporary employees. Temporary employees are not eligible for employment benefits.\nb. Scope of Appointment\nThe percentage of a full-time equivalent position (% FTE) an employee works affects both eligibility and level of benefits. See Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions for the % FTE of a continuing appointment that grants \"regular employee\" status and eligibility for most benefit plans and programs.\nc. Type of Position\nThe job classification defines whether the position is:\n(1) Salaried or Hourly-Paid\nSalaried employees are paid their semi-monthly salary (less authorized deductions) every pay period unless an exception (such as authorized overtime hours or leave without pay) is reported. Subject to exceptions, the gross salary amount of the paycheck is the same for each pay period, regardless of the number of working days in the period.\nHourly-paid employees are paid for actual hours worked (less authorized deductions) as shown on a timecard submitted for the pay period.\n(2) Exempt or Non-exempt\nSee the definitions in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. Employees who are exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act are not paid overtime.\n3. Compliance with Employment Law\na. Documentation of Eligibility for Employment\n(1) Completing Form I-9\nAll new and rehired employees must complete a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9 by the end of the day on their first day of (re)employment, and provide appropriate original document(s) to establish identity and work authorization. The hiring department, or other university designee, must review the original document(s) and complete the employer portion of this form within three business days of the first day of employment. Employers cannot specify which document(s) the employee must present. Completed forms are submitted to Payroll for review and document retention.\n(2) Updating Form I-9\nEligibility to work in the U.S. may expire for certain types of temporary visitors. Documentation of continued eligibility to work must be provided before the work eligibility expiration date.\n(3) Re-verifying Form I-9\nA new or re-verified Form I-9 must be completed after any break in employment. Certain exceptions apply for instructional staff/faculty, student, or seasonal/temporary employees returning to the same job in the same department following an expected break in employment of less than one year. See Topic Overview: Verify Eligibility for Employment and Form I-9 on the Fingate website for detailed guidelines. \n(4) Failure to Complete/Update Form I-9\nFailure to comply with USCIS Form I-9 requirements will result in ineligibility for employment and/or immediate termination.\nb. Tax Requirements\n(1) Withholding Tax Information\nNew employees must complete a withholding declaration at hire. In the absence of a completed withholding declaration, withholding tax will be applied as if the employee had claimed \"Single\" status with no withholding allowances on their W-4 and DE-4.\n(2) Tax Treaties\nSome employees who are not residents of the U.S. may qualify for full or partial exemption from withholding tax based on tax treaties between the U.S. and their country of tax residence. Texts of most treaties (in both English and the language of the other country) are available from the IRS website. For more information and to obtain the necessary documents to claim a tax treaty, see How to: Claim Tax Treaty for Salary Payments on the Fingate website.\n(3) Social Security Number\nA Social Security number is required for all employees working in the U.S. Employees who do not already have a Social Security number may begin employment, but must immediately apply for one and obtain a receipt of application. Once received, the hiring department must enter the employee's Social Security number in the university's human resource management system.\n4. Payroll Accounting\na. Semi-Monthly Payroll\nUniversity employees are paid semimonthly. Pay periods are the 1st through 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month. See Payroll Schedules and Deadlines on the Fingate website.\nb. Salary Approvals\nDepartment heads or other authorized university officers approve charges of salaries and wages to their projects, tasks and awards (PTAs) in accordance with budgets, compensation policies, and collective bargaining agreements. In addition to the department head, certain offices have responsibility for reviewing salaries and wages for specific categories of employees. Salary changes, supplementary compensation, salary during leave of absence, and termination of salary require the same authorization and review. Supervisors (or, in their absence, designees with first-hand knowledge of employees work hours) are responsible for approving employees' timecards, including leave usage for exempt and non-exempt employees and work hours for non-exempt employees.\nFaculty and Academic Staff: Salaries for faculty and academic staff are reviewed and approved by the cognizant dean and the Provost's Office.\nSalaried Staff: Salaries for staff employees are established, reviewed, and approved by the cognizant dean, director, or equivalent university officer. In some cases, review by Human Resources is also required.\nHourly-paid Staff: Hourly wages are reviewed and approved by Human Resources.\nStudents: See Undergraduate Student Wage Scales, Guide Memo 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships, and the Graduate Student Assistantship Supplement.\nc. Charges to Projects, Tasks and Awards\nFinancial Management Services (FMS) charges salary and wage expenditures to PTAs designated by the department through Labor Schedules. Oracle Business Intelligence (OBI) reporting provides information about charging salary through a number of monthly expenditure reports. The Consolidated Expenditure Reporting dashboard focuses on the PTAs where salary has already been charged. The Payroll and Labor Management dashboard focuses more on the individual employee. See the Fingate website for the training information and requirements that must be completed to access Labor Schedules.\n(1) Multiple Activities/Accounts\nIf an employee is paid from more than one PTA, the authorized portion of salary or wage is allocated to the appropriate PTA. The paycheck or bank deposit advice delivered to the employee combines all earnings into one check.\n(2) Organization Suspense Account\nEach department designates an unrestricted PTA as an Organization Suspense Account to which salaries of department employees are charged whenever the source of salary funding (such as a grant or contract) runs out and is not immediately replaced by alternative funding. Charges to Organization Suspense Account PTAs, which are charged to the expenditure type 51610, should be reviewed on a timely basis to determine if transfers are needed. See Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers.\n5. Taxes on Salaries and Wages\na. Taxable Earnings\nThe university withholds Federal, State, and other applicable taxes from all taxable earnings paid to employees. Taxable earnings include regular pay, overtime pay, supplementary compensation, and any additional and miscellaneous payments for work performed for the university. This may also include taxable reimbursements. See Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses for additional details on taxable reimbursements.\nb. W-2 Statements\nAt the end of each tax year (January 1 through December 31), Stanford compiles and distributes a W-2 statement for each employee. By default, W-2 statements are mailed to the employee's mailing address on file with the university. Employees may elect to have their W-2 statement sent to them electronically in the Axess portal. The university also sends Form W-2 data, as required, to Federal and State governments.\nc. Tax Exemptions\nEmployees may not claim more withholding allowances than those allowed by the Internal Revenue Service or Franchise Tax Board. Fewer allowances may be claimed or additional dollar amount of taxes may be withheld if an employee wishes to increase the amount of tax withheld. Information about completing the IRS W-4 form and Franchise Tax Board form DE-4, used to specify withholding allowances, is located on the Fingate website at How to: Declare or Change Withholding Allowances. \nd. Student Employees\nStudents who take jobs with the university while pursuing their studies are paid through the university payroll. Degree-seeking Stanford student employees, who are employed while enrolled in classes, do not pay Social Security taxes or Disability Insurance.\ne. Scholarships and Fellowships\nScholarship and fellowship payments are not considered payments for work performed and the recipients are not placed in an employer-employee relationship because of receipt of this money from the university.\nf. Research and Teaching Assistants\nResearch and teaching assistantships are taxable and tax is withheld from the semi-monthly salary.\ng. Non-California Residents\nEmployees who physically work in California are treated as California residents for California tax purposes.\nh. Tax Status of Non-U.S. Residents\nSalaries and wages paid to non-residents of the U.S. fall under the tax laws of the United States and the state of California. The specific provisions of the tax laws, treaties, conventions, and determinations in regard to non-residents are handled by the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board.\n6. Payroll Deductions\na. Deductions for Benefits\nEmployees eligible for benefits (e.g., regular staff, faculty) may pay the employee's share of the cost of some insurance programs and benefits by payroll deduction. For more information, go to the Cardinal at Work website.\nb. Other Authorized Deduction\nThe university has authorized voluntary payroll deductions for payments to certain organizations (such as the Stanford Faculty Club). Any employee who wishes to use this procedure should make arrangements directly with the organization for which the deduction is authorized. That organization will send the authorization to Payroll.\nc. Reporting Deductions\nDeductions from each paycheck are itemized on the pay statement. The amounts deducted are sent to the designated organizations.\nd. Cessation of Deductions\n(1) Benefits\nPayroll deductions for benefits cease during leaves of absence without pay. An employee on leave without pay will receive information from the university's leave administrator on how to pay for the employee's share of the costs for applicable insurance plans. Benefit deductions also stop when an employee's status changes to a non-benefits-eligible position (see Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions) and when employment terminates. At that time, terminated employees with retirement savings plans should review the available distribution options on the Cardinal at Work website.\n(2) Other Authorized Deductions\nSuch deductions cease during leaves of absence without pay, at termination of employment, or on retirement.\n7. Delivery of Checks and Bank Deposit Advices\na. Direct Deposit of Paychecks\nEmployees are encouraged to have their paychecks deposited directly into their bank accounts. Employees may use any bank, savings and loan or credit union that is a member of the Automated Clearing House and can accept electronic fund transfers. Direct deposit enrollment instructions are available at How to: Enroll/Update/Cancel Direct Deposit on the Fingate website.\nb. Delivery of Semi-monthly Paychecks\nPay statements are provided for all employees electronically in the Axess portal. Payroll distributes live paychecks to the mailing address on file. Paper pay statements are distributed through interdepartmental mail. Employees who wish to receive a paper pay statement must select this option in the Axess portal.\nc. Undelivered Checks\nPayroll will reach out to the department and/or the employee for checks returned by the Post Office in an effort to re-mail the checks to the employee. Paychecks issued in error must be returned to Payroll for cancellation and reversal of earnings from the employee's W-2.\nd. Stale-Dated Checks\nPaychecks are negotiable for six months from date of issue. Stale-dated checks should be returned to Payroll for reissue. Funds from checks not cashed after one year from date of issue are remitted to the Unclaimed Property Bureau.\ne. Delivery of Final Paycheck\nAn individual's final paycheck must include the total amount of salary or wages owed as of the date of termination. This includes all payments due, including accumulated, unused vacation leave, PTO and floating holiday, less authorized deductions. The department should contact Employee & Labor Relations in advance if questions arise.\nIf the university initiates the termination, or if the employee initiates the termination and gives at least 72 hours notice, the final paycheck must be given to the employee on the date of termination.\nWhen an employee initiates the termination and gives less than 72 hours notice, the final paycheck is due to the employee within 72 hours after termination. Departments are responsible for making sure final paychecks are delivered to employees under the time limitations provided by law. A completed termination transaction must be submitted to Payroll in order to process the final paycheck. \n8. Salary and Wage Calculations\na. Vacation Payment and Vacation Credit\nVacation earned but unused at termination is paid on the basis of the employee’s hourly rate at termination. For salaried employees at 100% FTE, the hourly rate is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year). If an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their accumulated vacation accruals. (See Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations). The vacation accrual template found at How to: Calculate Vacation Accrual on the Fingate website and can be used to calculate vacation when an employee terminates.\nb. Partial Pay Period Pay Calculation\nPay for less than a full pay period for new or terminating salaried employees is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year) and multiplying that number by the number of days the employee actually worked, including adjacent holidays, in the pay period multiplied by eight (assume eight hours/day for a full-time exempt employee.) Holidays are counted as workdays when the employee works or is on paid leave (including vacation), both the day immediately preceding and the day following a holiday.\n9. Special Situations\na. Salary Advances\nUnder certain circumstances as described below, salary advances are available to regular staff employees who are not in bargaining units. (Find information on salary advances for Bargaining Unit members in the applicable agreement.)\n(1) Vacation Advance\nAn employee scheduled to take vacation leave of at least 10 consecutive workdays outside the San Francisco Bay Area, may request early payment of any regular paychecks that would be issued during that period.\n(2) Emergency Advance\nOnly in an emergency and with the concurrence of their department, a regular employee may receive an advance of salary already earned in one pay period prior to the regular payday for that pay period. No more than two emergency advances for the same employee will be processed in a 12-month period.\nb. Faculty Terminations\nA faculty member leaving after completing the employment obligation but before the designated end date of their appointment may receive the balance of salary through a special processing procedure. If this option is exercised, the faculty member's status as an employee ends on the termination date. The termination date must not be later than the date of the final check."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-policies/out-state-employees","text":"2.2.2 Out-of-State Employees | Administrative Guide\nSkip to main content Skip to secondary navigation \nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nDecember 14, 2012 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 2.2.12, 23.11\nThis Guide Memo presents policy for hiring and/or reassigning out-of-state employees.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all Stanford University employees, including SLAC and employees covered by collective bargaining unit agreements.\n1. Definition\nAn \"out-of-state employee\" is defined as an employee of Stanford University whose primary work site is located outside the state of California. All individuals defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, are considered employees for the purpose of this Guide Memo. Consultants and contractors are not covered by this Memo.\n2. Policy\na. Applicable laws\nEmployees outside the state of California and Stanford University as their employer are subject to all employment-related laws of the state or foreign nation in which they work.\nState taxes, employment tax, and workers compensation provisions vary from state to state. University Payroll is primarily responsible for compliance with these various rules. Therefore, departments must notify Payroll immediately of any prospective arrangements involving Stanford employees outside the state of California by submitting a HelpSU ticket (Category: Financial Management, Request Type: Payroll).\nThe existence of Stanford University employees in a state outside California may trigger additional compliance requirements besides those relating to employment. Therefore, the hiring or reassignment of employees to positions outside California must be supported by an important University business purpose and not be merely an accommodation to the employee.\nb. Approval\nApproval of the hire or reassignment must be obtained in advance in writing from the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest administrative person within the organizational unit), or their designee, identifying the key University business reasons for the assignment.\nc. Payroll\nNotify University Payroll of the out-of-state assignment in advance of the start of work outside of California by sending a completed Approval of Out-of-State Employee Approval form to the Payroll Office.\nd. Administrative costs\nAdministrative costs per capita for out-of-state employees are high due to the extraordinary costs to assure compliance and, in some cases, liability for unemployment and disability benefits. Therefore, a one-time $500 fee is charged to the assigning department for each new out-of-state employee on payroll, to be assessed when the assignment begins. Departments are also charged $200 each year for each out-of-state employee. Failure to report out-of-state employees to University Payroll in a timely manner may result in compliance penalties, which will be assessed to the assigning department.\ne. Benefits\nThe choices of health and welfare benefits plans may be more limited for employees who work outside of the Bay Area. You can find more information at https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards.\nf. When Employee Works in California\nNotify University Payroll of any days that the out-of state employee is present in California on Stanford business. Compensation earned on such days is considered California-sourced taxable income regardless of employee’s state of residence and is subject to all California tax provisions. Use the Report of Days Worked in California for Out-Of-State Employees form to report annually the number of days an out-of-state worker works in California.\n3. For More Information\nContact University Payroll by submitting a HelpSU ticket (Category: Financial Management, Request Type: Payroll)."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-policies/requesting-lactation-accommodation","text":"2.2.5 Requesting a Lactation Accommodation\nApplicability: This policy applies to all faculty, academic staff, other teaching staff, and staff employees.\nStudents and postdoctoral scholars with questions about lactation accommodations may contact the Title IX Office at titleix@stanford.edu or 650-497-4955.\n1. Policy Summary\nStanford University supports the importance of health and bonding for parents nursing their infants. It is the policy of the university to follow all state and federal laws and regulations in this area, including California Labor Code (Sections 1030-1033), Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act. In promoting a family-friendly work environment and to ensure equality of access for employees who wish to breastfeed, the university will provide reasonable accommodations to enable employees to express breast milk.\nLactation spaces are available to all members of the university community, including students, postdoctoral scholars, and third parties who participate in Stanford programs and activities. The WorkLife Office maintains a list of campus spaces that may be used for lactation.\nAll Stanford University affiliated nursing parents, including students and postdoctoral scholars, are encouraged to register for the Stanford Lactation Support Program. Additional resources for lactation support information and educational resources are available on Cardinal at Work at: worklife.stanford.edu. \n2. Implementation and Responsibility\na. Employees:\nare responsible for notifying a supervisor as soon as a lactation accommodation is needed. It is recommended that an employee anticipating an accommodation discuss their needs with their supervisor before a family leave is taken, including the anticipated schedule and request to access an appropriate space. Requests from staff employees should be made to the supervisor or Human Resources Manager. Faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff should contact their Department Chair and departmental faculty affairs officer.\nb. Supervisors:\nare responsible for receiving requests for a lactation accommodation, and in consultation with the Human Resources Manager, reviewing accommodation requirements, identifying appropriate space and schedule for the employee, and discussing the accommodation with the employee. In the case of faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff, the term ‘supervisor’ in this policy refers to the Department Chair.\nc. Human Resources Managers:\nare responsible for advising supervisors of accommodation requirements and assisting supervisors in consultation with the building or facilities managers to identify appropriate space to accommodate the employee. To identify the local Human Resources office, call the appropriate number: Campus 650-721-4272; School of Medicine 650-497-2750; SLAC 650-926-2358.\nd. Department Chairs and Departmental Faculty Affairs Officers:\nare responsible for receiving faculty, academic staff and other teaching staff requests for a lactation accommodation and, in consultation with the Human Resources Manager or departmental faculty affairs officer, reviewing accommodation requests and requirements, identifying appropriate space for the employee and discussing the accommodation with the employee.\n3. Process - Recommended Steps\na. Step One – Request\nEmployees are responsible for initiating the request for a lactation accommodation. The request does not need to be made in writing, nor is a doctor’s note required. The employee should consider discussing a request with their supervisor or Human Resources Manager before taking a family leave.\nb. Step Two – Discussion\nWhen received, the supervisor or Human Resources Manager will meet with the employee to acknowledge the request and help develop an accommodation. The supervisor or Human Resources Manager should confirm that the employee has a private, clean and secure place to express breastmilk (see Section 5: Identifying Space). If the employee has questions or concerns about expressing breastmilk at work, questions should be referred to the Human Resources Manager or the WorkLife Office.\nc. Step Three – Follow up\nThe supervisor or Human Resources Manager should confirm the accommodation in writing and offer to revisit the plan with the employee after two to three weeks to see if any changes are needed. \n4. Accommodation Periods\nAn accommodation includes a reasonable amount of time taken as needed by the employee to express breastmilk in a space that complies with state and federal requirements (see Section 5: Identifying Space). When possible, time should be taken during regularly scheduled meal and rest periods. The number of breaks needed to express breastmilk may vary. A nursing parent will typically need two or three breaks during an eight-hour period; however, additional break times may be necessary. If the time to express breastmilk exceeds an employee’s regularly-scheduled meal or rest periods, non-exempt employees may request to be provided an opportunity to make up time per Admin Guide Memo 2.1.5. If no reasonable opportunity exists for a non-exempt employee to make up time, the time to express breastmilk that exceeds paid rest periods will not be paid. \nIf an employee, who is otherwise entitled to rest breaks or meal periods under Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees, Sections 2.e-f, is not provided reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk, a penalty of one hour of the employee's straight time hourly rate must be paid to the employee each day there is such a violation. Any employee who believes they have not been provided with reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk should immediately report their concerns to their local Human Resources office or University Human Resources-Employee & Labor Relations. Employees may also pursue complaints directly with the California Labor Commissioner's Office.\n5. Identifying Space\nAppropriate space that complies with state and federal requirements includes any space that can be made private, shielded from view and free from intrusions from coworkers or the public, and is not located in a bathroom. Appropriate space can include a private office, a conference room with a locking door, or any other compliant space that can be secured and shielded from view. Appropriate space must include all of the following requirements:\nBe safe, clean and free of hazardous materials;\nContain a surface to place a breast pump and personal items;\nContain a place to sit; and\nHave access to electricity or alternative devices, including, but not limited to, extension cords or charging stations needed to operate an electric or battery-powered breast pump.\nThe employee must be provided access to a sink with running water and a refrigerator suitable for storing milk in close proximity to the employee's workspace.\n6. Employee's Own or Adjacent Building\nEvery effort should be made to identify space in the employee’s building when possible. It may be necessary to identify more than one space in order to meet the needs of both the employee and department. Space may be identified at an adjacent building within a reasonable walking distance and that is accessible to the employee during the arranged lactation schedule. A reasonable distance is recommended as no more than a 5-minute walk from the employee’s building. For multi-use spaces, the use of the room for lactation will take precedence over other uses during the time it is used for lactation.\n7. Identified Lactation Locations\nIf space cannot be identified in the employee’s building or an adjacent building, the WorkLife Office maintains a list of campus spaces that may be used for lactation."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/sick-time-temporary-and-casual-staff-employees","text":"2.1.22 Sick Time for Temporary and Casual Staff Employees\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 2.1.21\nThis Guide Memo describes paid sick time accrual and usage policies for temporary and casual staff employees.\nApplicability: Applies to all casual and temporary staff employees as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. In this Guide Memo, these casual and temporary staff employees are referred to as “contingent employee(s).”\n1. Accrual\na. Eligibility\nContingent employees delineated in the Applicability section above accrue and use sick time as described below.\nb. Accrual of Sick Time\nContingent employees accrue sick time at the rate of .03334 hours per hour of straight time. This equates to one (1) hour for every 30 hours worked.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year-to-year, with a maximum limit of 80 hours or ten (10) days.\nWhen a contingent employee leaves one position and accepts another one within the University, the contingent employee retains their sick time balance; the contingent employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals. \nIf a contingent employee separates from the University and is rehired by the University within 12 months from the date of separation, previously accrued and unused paid sick days shall be reinstated.\nSick time shall not be paid out upon separation of employment.\n2. Use of Sick Time\nContingent employees may begin using sick time on the 90th calendar day after the start of employment with the University. Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. The use of sick days is limited to 40 hours or five (5) scheduled work days each year of employment, whichever is greater. Sick time may only be used for an absence that a contingent employee has during scheduled work hours.\nSick time may be used for the following reasons:\na. Absence Due to Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a contingent employee’s illness or injury prevents the contingent employee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments, including: \nDiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventative care\nThose appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking\nSick time may be used by a contingent employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking in order to:\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or welfare of the victim or their child\nSeek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nObtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nObtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nParticipate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation\nd. Family Sick Time\nContingent employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a contingent employee's family member. For the purpose of this policy, family member includes, as the terms are defined by law, only the contingent employee's:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the contingent employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the contingent employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child’s age or dependency status)\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a contingent employee or the contingent employee’s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the contingent employee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\nContingent employees may use up to 40 hours or five (5) days of their accrued sick time for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a designated person. “Designated person” means a person identified by the contingent employee at the time the contingent employee requests paid sick days. A contingent employee is limited to one “designated person” per 12-month period for such paid sick days.\n3. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe contingent employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how contingent employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the contingent employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the contingent employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. If a contingent employee has accrued sick time available and has not reached applicable limits of sick time use per year of employment, a request to use sick time should not be denied because details are not provided about the sick time use. Contingent employees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department. Where flexible schedules work for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a contingent employee’s work hours.\nb. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use\nThe University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to record sick time credited, used, and accumulated for all contingent employees. Contingent employees record hours of sick time used in the Axess Timecard each pay period. The use of sick time is limited to 40 hours (or five scheduled workdays, whichever is greater) during each year of employment. Up to 40 hours of sick time use may be recorded in Axess; if a contingent employee has three scheduled work days of sick time use that exceeds 40 hours, the contingent employee should request assistance from the local Human Resources Office. Contingent employees are not paid for time spent away from work in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment, and such time is not recorded in Axess. (For information about Axess, see the Time & Leave System overview.)\nc. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service, calculated based upon work hours recorded during the previous month. If a contingent employee needs to use sick time that has been accrued but not yet credited in Axess, the contingent employee should speak to the local Human Resources Office for assistance.\nd. Tax Status\nSick time is taxable income. Federal, state and FICA taxes are deducted.\ne. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a contingent employee’s use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a contingent employee’s failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met.\n(2) Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time\nIf the University has reasonable basis to believe that a contingent employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five (5) scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a contingent employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable Medical Evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner’s statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when the contingent employee is released to return to work.\nf. Sources of Funds for Sick Time\nAs sick time is used to replace scheduled work hours, it should be recorded in Axess on the timecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is charged to the department that owns this job record.\ng. Applicable Laws\nThe intent of this Guide Memo 2.1.22 is to meet or exceed requirements of all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522 and Senate Bill 616.\n4. Disability Insurance and Family Temporary Disability\na. Voluntary Disability Insurance (VDI) and Short Term Disability (STD)\nThe VDI and STD plans provide partial income continuation for periods of disability. Stanford’s VDI and STD plans are administered by Lincoln Financial and there are specific rules regarding disability insurance benefits, including rules about eligibility and duration. For more information, contingent employees should contact their supervisors, the applicable local Human Resources office, or contact the University HR Service Team; they also may contact Lincoln Financial at (800) 896-9375 or submit a claim at https://www.mylincolnportal.com (claimant service ID: stanford).\nb. Family Temporary Disability (FTD)\nFTD provides partial income replacement to care for seriously ill family members or to bond with a new child.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/legal-entities/establishment-and-governance-legal-entities","text":"3.7.1 Establishment and Governance of Legal Entities\nAuthority\nVice President and General Counsel, and the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer\nLast Updated\nSeptember 28, 2017 \nEffective Date\nSeptember 28, 2017 \nPrint\nApplicability: To facilitate compliance with the responsibilities discussed above, this policy sets forth requirements for the creation, acquisition, disposition, and termination of legal entities affiliated with Stanford. \nIn addition to the requirements set forth below, the Office of the General Counsel and Financial Management Services may assist with the ongoing maintenance of legal entities affiliated with Stanford.\n1. Establishment and Governance of Legal Entities\nStanford University will, on occasion, create or acquire a legal entity in furtherance of the university’s mission. These legal entities can serve many purposes, including the conduct of operations critical to the university (such as support of business registrations in countries outside of the United States). They also carry certain responsibilities, including organizational governance, financial controls, risk management, and government filings.\nThis memo addresses the limited circumstances when a legal entity may be created, acquired, disposed of, or terminated by Stanford. This policy does not apply to investment entities or those entities received via donor gift, which are subject to other relevant policies and guidelines of the Stanford Management Company and the Office of Development, as applicable.\nAs used in this policy, the term “legal entity” includes an organization recognized as separate from its owners by the relevant taxing authority or is otherwise recognized as having legal standing under the applicable laws. Examples of a legal entity include a corporation (for-profit or not-for-profit), limited liability company, partnership, unincorporated association, or trust. A legal entity may be formed within or outside the United States.\n2. Legal Entities Affiliated with Stanford\nA legal entity affiliated with Stanford may be created, acquired, disposed of, or terminated only with the approval of both the Office of the General Counsel and Financial Management Services, per the procedure below. The university's individual schools and other operating units cannot take independent action with respect to legal entities. Stanford employees contemplating the creation, acquisition, disposition or termination of an affiliated legal entity should contact the Office of the General Counsel, which will provide advice on the approach best suited to support the programmatic objective. Registration and maintenance of a legal entity over its lifetime can be both time consuming and costly. Other alternatives may be more expedient and compatible with the goals of shorter term academic activities, such as a contractual arrangement with a local institution or seeking an exemption from registration, if possible. \nIn the event the General Counsel and the Senior Associate Vice President for Finance determine that it is necessary to take one of the above actions with respect to a legal entity, the General Counsel’s Office will provide guidance on the process. The department or school sponsoring the legal entity will be responsible for covering any costs arising from outside counsel and other agents that must be retained by the university to accomplish the requested action. In the event an entity is created or acquired, additional procedures will need to be established and followed by the sponsor to ensure the ongoing governance and maintenance of the entity."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/cost-transfers","text":"3.2.2 Cost Transfers | Administrative Guide\nSkip to main content Skip to secondary navigation \nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJuly 26, 2022 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 38\nThis Guide Memo sets out policies and procedures for transferring already incurred costs from one expenditure account (Project-Task-Award) to another. Cost transfers may also be called transfers of expense.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all Stanford employees responsible for financial analysis and management of expense transactions.\n1. Cost Transfer Policies\nA cost transfer is an after-the-fact reallocation of the cost associated with a transaction from one Project-Task-Award (PTA) to another. Although costs should always be charged to the correct PTA, cost transfers are sometimes necessary. To be allowable, cost transfers must be timely, be fully documented, conform to University and sponsor allowability standards (that is, allowable under the terms of the sponsored agreement), and have appropriate authorizing signatures. See Guide Memo 3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures.\na. Error Correction\nCorrection of errors is required on all PTAs. Errors may include clerical errors (such as typographical errors or transposition of digits in the PTA and expenditure types). Other errors may be detected upon review or certification of monthly expenditure reports. It may be that an employee's Labor Schedule was not updated, an individual's effort was redirected, or a purchase was charged to a PTA other than the one that ultimately benefited from the use of the items purchased. All errors should be corrected as soon as they are detected.\nb. Active Sponsored Project PTAs\nRefer to Cost Sharing in the Research Policy Handbook, Section 15.3. In addition to deadlines, it addresses:\nDocumentation\nSponsor requirements\nPre-award costs\nCosts benefiting more than one project\nOverdrafts\nc. Documentation\nOnline cost transfer documentation must clearly show:\nThe expense directly benefits the receiving PTA\nThe expense is allowable on the receiving PTA\nThe reason the expense was charged incorrectly to the first PTA\nThe allocation methodology used if transferring expenses to multiple PTAs\nThat any systematic reasons which might cause this problem to be repeated have been addressed\nThe reason for any delay in the timely processing of the transfer\nd. Cost Transfer Deadlines\nCost transfers should be prepared and submitted as soon as the need for a transfer is identified, and should be completed no later than six months after the cost is posted. Transfers submitted after the deadline must include a valid reason for the delay, and will generally not be allowed to be transferred onto a sponsored project. When transfers are delayed, a correction to the original source of an entry (e.g., an update to a Labor Schedule) may not be made timely. Therefore, care should also be taken to ensure that subsequent charges are either appropriate to the original PTA or also transferred.\n2. Cost Transfer Procedures\na. Getting Started\nCost transfers are submitted using the university’s Oracle Financials iJournals and Labor Distribution Adjustments systems. For information about accessing and using these systems, see Learn About iJournals and Learn About Labor Distribution Adjustments on the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nNew iJournals are used to transfer all costs with the exception of salary or student aid expenses that were originally posted on or after September 1, 2003\nHistorical iJournals are used to transfer any expenses (including salary and student aid expenses) that were originally posted before September 1, 2003\nSalary iJournals are used to transfer salary expenses originally incurred (determined by the expenditure item date) on or after September 1, 2003 and before April 1, 2005.\nLabor Distribution Adjustments are used to transfer salary expenses originally incurred after March 31, 2005\nAllocation iJournals are used to distribute costs based on proportional benefit to a project. Allocations are used when it is difficult to determine in advance how much to charge each PTA for a shared supply or service. Allocations are often used to distribute costs from Service Centers, Auxiliaries, or expenditure allocation PTAs. Often allocations are repetitive, or are required on a repetitive basis.\nb. Authorization Requirements\nAll users of university financial system must have an active SUNetID and password.\nFinancial transaction preparers and approvers must be granted appropriate authority privileges using the Authority Manager system and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information, see Authority to Create Financial Transactions and Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford’s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nc. Signatures\nOnline signature of the person responsible for approving the Project-Task/Award to be debited is required for most iJournal types. Online signature for the Project-Task/Award to be credited is required for Allocation iJournals. In all cases, the department initiating the transfer should make sure all individuals responsible for affected PTAs are informed of the entry."}

Regular Employees\nEmployees have \"regular\" status when appointed at 50% FTE or more for at least six consecutive months, or as described in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Regular status is a requirement for most health and welfare benefit plans and programs. In the Administrative Guide, \"benefits-eligible\" refers to regular employees who are eligible for University sponsored health and welfare benefits.\n9. Casual Employees\nEmployees on the University payroll appointed less than 50% FTE and work no more than 980 hours during the calendar year for all job assignments. [Note: Departments may elect a discretionary limit of less than 980 hours based on their business need.] Once a casual employee reaches the 980-hour limit, the position should be posted and filled as a regular, benefits-eligible employee on the University payroll for any further work in the same calendar year. An individual should not be hired or rehired into a casual position if it can reasonably be anticipated that the assignment will result in the employee working 980 hours or more in a calendar year as a casual (or temporary) employee.\n10. Temporary Employees\nEmployees on the University payroll appointed at 50% FTE or more for no longer than six consecutive months and work no more than 980 hours during the six-month period for all job assignments.

Stanford Student Employees\nEmployees who are registered Stanford students have \"student\" status excepting those whose employment is totally independent of and unrelated to their Stanford student role. Stanford students who are not currently registered are considered casual or temporary employees.\n12. Exempt Employees\nAll University employees, including students, faculty, and staff are subject to federal and state requirements regarding minimum wages, payment for overtime work, and related record keeping. However, employees may be exempt from the overtime pay and record keeping requirements when they occupy bona fide professional, managerial, or executive positions. At Stanford, \"exempt\" positions typically include executive officers, faculty, academic staff, other teaching staff, and certain professional, administrative, and executive staff. The Vice President of Human Resources, in accordance with provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor determines exempt status.\n13. Non-exempt Employees\nThese are the employees who are not \"exempt\" under federal and state overtime regulations. They must receive compensation for overtime work.\n14. Salary Basis of Compensation\nA \"salary,\" as distinguished from an \"hourly wage\" is compensation established by the month (e.g. $1,000 per month) with the amount remaining the same each month without regard to the variations from month to month in the normal number of working hours (e.g., in 2010 a salaried full-time employee received the same salary for January with 184 working hours and for February with 160 working hours.)\n15. Hourly Basis of Compensation\nCompensation established on an hourly basis, so that pay varies with the actual number of hours worked (or on paid leave) in each pay period.\n16. Pay Period\nEach month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-policies/requesting-workplace-accommodations-employees","text":"2.2.7 Requesting Workplace Accommodations For Employees With Disabilities\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 23.5\nThis Guide Memo outlines Stanford University's policies and procedures for employee requests for disability-related accommodations.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all University employees.\n1. Policy\nStanford University values diversity and is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all qualified employees, including those with disabilities. The University follows all state and federal laws and regulations, including the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (CFEHA), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). Disability is defined as any physical or mental impairment that limits one or more of an individual's major life activities (e.g., caring for oneself, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, sitting, standing). To ensure equality of access for employees with disabilities, the University will provide reasonable accommodations and auxiliary aids to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of their job and participate in University programs and activities.\n2. Implementation and Responsibility\na. Employees\nEmployees are responsible for initiating requests and cooperating in the interactive process for any desired disability-related workplace accommodations. Requests by non-faculty employees should go to the supervisor or human resources manager; faculty employees should contact their Chair, departmental or school faculty affairs officer, or the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer.\nb. Supervisors\nSupervisors are responsible for receiving requests for workplace accommodations, informing employees of the process, and referring requests to the appropriate human resources manager. Supervisors, in coordination with their local human resources manager, are responsible for initiating a discussion concerning accommodations when they have reason to believe an employee's disability precludes the employee from initiating a request. Supervisors will promptly inform the local human resources manager of all requests and accommodations.\nc. Human Resources Managers\nHuman Resources Managers are responsible for evaluating the request, determining what type of documentation is necessary, and determining if the requested accommodation is appropriate and effective. To identify your human resources manager, see the human resources managers list.\nd. ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer\nThe ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer provides information on the employment provisions of the ADA and employer obligations. You can also contact the Compliance Officer for information on campus accessibility, how to get technical and assistive equipment, and funding sources. You can reach the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer at the Diversity & Access Office located in Kingscote Gardens, 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, (650) 725-0326, FAX (650) 723-1791, TTY (650) 723-1216.\ne. Chairs and Faculty Affairs Officers\nChairs and Faculty Affairs Officers are responsible for receiving requests for workplace accommodations and referring requests to the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer for handling under procedures similar to Section 3.\n3. Process\na. Step One - Request\nThe employee is responsible for requesting a workplace accommodation for their disability. The request shall be made to either the employee's supervisor or the local human resources manager. Requests should be in writing and include:\nEmployee's name, telephone number, and address\nDepartment\nSupervisor\nLimitations caused by the medical condition or disability (not the underlying medical diagnosis)\nWhat accommodation is being requested\nBrief explanation of how the requested accommodation will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of their job.\nb. Step Two - Discussion\nWhen received, the supervisor and/or human resources manager will meet with the employee to acknowledge the request and explain the process. The supervisor or human resources manager will also meet with the employee as necessary to discuss the request and accommodation alternatives.\nc. Step Three - Providing Necessary Documentation\nThe supervisor and/or human resources manager evaluating the requested accommodation will determine what type of documentation is necessary to proceed with the process. This may vary depending on the particular circumstances and the accommodation requested. It is the employee's responsibility to provide the requested documentation supporting the request for accommodation. If the University determines it is appropriate to get a second professional opinion concerning the nature or impact of a physical or mental disability, the Department will bear the cost of the second opinion. Any request for a second opinion must be coordinated with University Human Resources--Employee & Labor Relations. The request for an accommodation will be evaluated once the employee submits all documentation to the human resources manager and/or the supervisor.\nd. Step Four - Evaluation\nAppropriate accommodations are determined following an individualized assessment of each request. The supervisor and/or human resources manager will consider the needs and requests for reasonable accommodation to determine whether the necessary equipment or services exist already in a different department or unit before investing in new equipment or additional services. Among the factors considered in determining reasonable accommodations for employees are:\nDoes the employee's physical or mental condition limit one or more major life activities?\nHow does the limitation(s) affect the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the job?\nWill the requested accommodation allow the employee to perform the essential job functions effectively?\nWill the requested accommodation alter or remove an essential function of the job?\nWhat impact will the requested accommodation or modification have on the department or unit?\nThe University is not required to provide an accommodation that will eliminate an essential function of the job in question or to provide an accommodation or service that is personal in nature, such as a hearing aid or wheelchair. Furthermore, the University is not required to lower performance, production or conduct standards, or alter attendance requirements expected of all employees.\ne. Step Five - Notification\nThe supervisor and/or human resources manager evaluating the request for an accommodation shall provide the employee with written notification of the determination within 15 calendar days of receiving the completed request (including the requested documentation). If the determination includes an accommodation, the notice will also include the expected implementation date. If the supervisor or the human resources manager needs additional time to assess a request or to provide an accommodation, they shall provide the employee with written notification of the status of the request and the proposed date of determination.\n4. Funding\nIf the accommodation is appropriate and reasonable, then the Department bears the initial responsibility for funding the accommodation. If the cost is beyond the Department's means, the cost should be shared by higher levels in the Department's/office's reporting line. For information on additional funding resources for disability-related accommodations, contact the Diversity & Access Office at (650) 725-0326.\n5. Resolving Disagreements\nIn the event an employee disagrees with the determination and/or proposed accommodation, they may contact the ADA/Section 504 Compliance Officer at the Diversity & Access Office, Kingscote Gardens, 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, telephone 723-0755, FAX 723-1791, for assistance in resolving the disagreement.\n6. Confidentiality and Records\nAll University employees have a legal obligation to maintain confidentiality regarding a staff or faculty member's disability-related information. To that end, supervisors and local human resources managers shall provide information to staff and faculty only when necessary to facilitate accommodations."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-policies/controlled-substances-and-alcohol","text":"2.2.8 Controlled Substances and Alcohol\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 23.6\nApplicability: Applies to all Stanford employees, certain individuals who are not Stanford employees (as defined in the Policy section) and students.\n1. Background and Purpose\na. Health Risks\nIt is widely recognized that the misuse and abuse of controlled substances, illegal drugs (collectively called controlled substances1 and alcohol are major contributors to serious health problems and social and civic concerns. The health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of controlled substances and alcohol include various physical and mental consequences including addiction, severe disability and death. Information concerning the known effects of alcohol and specific drugs is available from the Office of Substance Use Programs, Education & Resources at (650) 723-3429.\nb. Federal Legislation\nIn response to these concerns, the U.S. Congress passed the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991.In accordance with these Acts, Stanford University has enacted the following policy applicable to all employees and students.\n1Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C.812 and include, but are not limited to, such substances as marijuana, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines.\n2. Policy\nIt is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace or as part of any of the University's activities. (For clarification of what activities related to controlled substances and alcohol are unlawful, see the Appendix at the end of this Guide Memo.) The workplace and campus include all Stanford premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Moreover, employees are prohibited from being under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol while at work. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions up to and including termination of employment or expulsion. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\na. Employees\nAs a condition of employment, all Stanford employees are expected to report to work in a condition that enables them to perform their job duties, with or without reasonable accommodation, in a safe manner that does not jeopardize their own safety or the safety of others.\nEmployees are prohibited from being under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol while at work. \"Under the influence\" is a condition where an employee's sensory, cognitive, motor functions or job related capabilities are affected, impaired or diminished and may be exhibited through various behaviors including slurred speech, difficulty walking, red eyes, erratic or threatening behavior, the odor of alcohol, etc. (Note: Lawfully prescribed prescription drugs used in accordance with their instructions are not subject to this policy.)\nEmployees who unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess or use controlled substances or unlawfully use, possess, or distribute alcohol in the workplace, on the campus, or as part of any University activity will be subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment. Employees required to obtain Commercial Drivers Licenses to drive vehicles heavier than 26,000 pounds, vehicles placarded for the transportation of hazardous materials, and/or vehicles designed to carry 16 or more persons are subject to a protocol of testing for the use of drugs and alcohol in accordance with DOT guidelines. Employees at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory must comply with SLAC's Fitness for Duty policy.\nb. Students\nStudents are bound by this policy and the Stanford Student Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy.\nc. Others on Campus\nIndividuals who are not Stanford employees, but who perform work at Stanford for its benefit (e.g., independent contractors, temporary employees provided by agencies, visitors engaged in joint projects at Stanford or volunteers) are required to comply with this policy. Such individuals who violate this policy may be barred from further work for and at Stanford.\nd. Rehabilitation\nSuccessful completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program (including participation in aftercare) may be considered evidence of eligibility for continued or future employment or for reinstatement of student status.\ne. Reporting of Convictions\nAn employee who is convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere) of a criminal drug statute violation occurring in the workplace or on Stanford property must, notify Stanford University of the conviction within five days after the conviction. Notification must be in writing to the local human resources office, the Associate Vice President of Employee & Labor Relations (for staff) or the Dean (for faculty).\n3. Guide to Supervisors\nResponsibility for effective implementation and enforcement of the Stanford Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy begins with supervisors. Supervisors must be alert to indications or evidence of the use or presence of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace.\na. Communication\nSupervisors must make sure that employees are aware of Stanford's Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy and understand that violation of this policy is a serious matter and cause for disciplinary action including possible termination.\nb. Consultation with Human Resources\nIf and when an employee is suspected of violating this policy, the supervisor should consult with the local human resources office to plan and carry out an appropriate investigation and resolution of the situation.\nc. Impaired Performance on the Job: Under the Influence of Controlled Substances or Alcohol in the Workplace\nPerformance problems on the job can have many causes. In discussions with an employee concerning any performance problem, the supervisor should offer to help the employee determine the source of the problems and offer guidance on appropriate assistance, counseling or other resources.\nWhen job performance has become impaired, the supervisor should take normal corrective action, beginning with discussion with the employee. When the behavior of an employee on the job raises safety concerns for the employee and/or others in the workplace, the supervisor must take immediate action and prohibit the employee from continuing on the job until it is determined that they are fit to return to work and perform safely. Specific actions to be taken depend on the facts of the particular situation. Supervisors should consult with their local human resources office and document any cases of suspected employee impairment while at work.\nIn a situation when the employee acknowledges to the supervisor that poor performance or unacceptable conduct results from a substance or alcohol abuse problem, the supervisor should urge the employee to seek help from a qualified substance abuse treatment resource. If the employee requests a leave of absence for a rehabilitation program, the supervisor should take normal steps to review the leave request. After a review of the situation, any misconduct, performance issues or policy violations which occur before, or coincident with, a voluntary admission of impairment may form the basis of disciplinary consequences up to and including termination.\nd. Testing for Drugs and Alcohol\nSupervisors of employees who are required to obtain a Commercial Drivers License to drive vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds, vehicles placarded for the transportation of hazardous materials, and/or vehicles designed to carry 16 or more persons are responsible for making sure the appropriate tests for the use of drugs and/or alcohol are administered through a suitable drug testing service provider. The department/ school is responsible for managing the testing process and determining if the use of an outside vendor is needed for this purpose.\n4. Getting Help\nEmployees concerned about substance use, abuse, and rehabilitation are strongly encouraged to contact their physician, their medical plan, or the Stanford Faculty & Staff Help Center, which can refer employees to appropriate resources (community or private agencies) that provide complete, confidential substance abuse counseling.\nStanford's medical insurance plans provide coverage for substance abuse programs. Go to the Stanford Benefits website for additional information.\nStudents (including employees who are also Stanford students) are urged to contact the Office of Substance Use Programs, Education & Resources at (650) 723-3429.\n5. Legal Sanctions\nThe unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, and/or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is regulated by a number of federal, state and local laws. These laws impose legal sanctions for both misdemeanor and felony convictions. Criminal penalties for convictions can range from fines and probation to denial or revocation of federal benefits (such as student loans) to imprisonment and forfeiture of personal and real property.\nThis Appendix contains a list of some of the laws pertaining to the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance or alcohol. Because the laws change from time to time, the information provided in the Appendix is illustrative, not exhaustive. More detailed and current information is available from the Stanford Department of Public Safety.\nAPPENDIX\nGenerally, as of February 2006 it is a criminal offense:\nto illegally manufacture, sell, distribute or possess controlled substances (those listed in Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.812) (21 U.S.C. 828, 841, 844, 859, 860)\nto unlawfully possess or possess for sale controlled substances specified in California Health and Safety Code 11054, 11055, 11056, 11057, 11058\nto possess, cultivate, sell or possess for sale marijuana (CA Health and Safety Codes 11357, 11358, 11359)\nto use or be under the influence of a controlled substance (CA Health and Safety Code 11550)\nto transport, sell, or distribute marijuana to a minor or to use a minor to transport, sell, or distribute marijuana (CA Health and Safety Code 11361)\nto possess, furnish or manufacture drug paraphernalia (CA Health and Safety Code 11362 et seq.)\nto provide any alcoholic beverage to a person under 21 or to any obviously intoxicated person (CA Business and Professions Code 25658; 25602)\nto be under the influence of alcohol in a public place and unable to exercise care for one's own safety or that of others [CA Penal Code 647(f)]\nfor persons under 21 to have any container of alcohol in any public place or any place open to the public (Business and Professions Code 25662)\nto operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants or with a blood alcohol level of .08% or higher (CA Vehicle Code 23152)\nfor any person under the age of 21 to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level of .05% or higher (CA Vehicle Code 23140)\nto have an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle and for persons under 21 to drive a vehicle carrying alcohol or to possess alcohol while in a motor vehicle (CA Vehicle Code 23223; 23224)\nto have in one's possession or to use false evidence of age and identity to purchase alcohol (CA Business and Professions Code 25661)\nfor any person under age 21 to purchase alcohol (CA Business and Professions Code 25658.5)"}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/general-employment-policies/employee-training","text":"2.2.9 Employee Training | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nAugust 30, 2012 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 23.7\nStanford University is obligated to provide necessary training to employees of the University, and retains the right to identify certain training as required. Where identified as required, training will be considered a job responsibility, as it is integral to the quality of work performed by the employee and contributes to the overall effectiveness of organizational operations.\nAuthority: This policy is established by the Vice President of Human Resources, who determines training requirements upon consultation with the other University officials and groups as appropriate. Additionally, Deans, Vice Presidents or members of the Provost's staff may determine that specialized training is required within their Schools or organizations. Such training will be identified and delivered locally, with support from central training providers as appropriate and available.\nApplicability: The policy is applicable to all Stanford University employees, including faculty, staff and students.\n1. Purpose/Rationale\nThe increasing complexity of the work environment requires continuing development of competencies and upgrading of knowledge and skills relating directly to the performance of work. In addition, changes in external regulation and Stanford policies, procedures and practices have created risks/liabilities which require the delivery of consistent information to Stanford University employees (faculty, staff and students) with specific responsibilities. The documented delivery of training is in some cases mandated by external agencies and subject to audit review (for example, in areas such as financial management, health and safety practices, and sponsored project administration).\n2. Actions and Instructions\na. Department Managers\nare responsible for:\nIdentifying those employees who perform work requiring specific training.\nTaking necessary actions to enable the delivery of necessary training, including identifying appropriate courses and providing release time as needed for participation.\nMonitoring job performance, and incorporating ongoing training and development as an element of continuing staff performance appraisal.\nProviding support after training to maximize application of skills on the job.\nb. Departments providing required University-wide training\nare responsible for:\nResponding to client needs by developing curriculum to address job requirements; considering the content and delivery of training to maximize value, while minimizing the time needed to achieve proficiency, and considering alternatives to classroom instruction whenever feasible.\nContinually evaluating the effectiveness of training programs.\nRecommending to the Vice President of Human Resources specific training for required delivery to University populations. Such recommendations must include definition of:- rationale for requiring training- populations for which training is a requirement- delivery plans (including necessary resources)- methods for documenting delivery\n3. Documentation and Enforcement\nSatisfactory completion of required training must be documented within the organization requiring the training. Such documentation is a prerequisite for authorization to perform certain tasks; e.g., for authority to expend University funds or for access to particular information or materials.\n4. Cognizant Offices\nQuestions about this policy may be directed to Learning & Organizational Effectiveness at (650) 723-4635 and learningdev@stanford.edu. This office chairs the University Training Advisory Committee.\n5. Definitions\na. Required Training\nMaterial for which competency must be demonstrated as a condition of employment in certain jobs, or for the assignment of certain tasks.\nb. University-wide\nHaving general applicability to members of the University community, not specific to any School, department or office.\nc. Local Training\nHaving specific applicability to the needs of an individual School, department or office.\nd. Release Time\nTime away from the job made available for participation in training or other job-related activities. Release time is compensable working time."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/personnel-files-and-data","text":"2.1.3 Personnel Files and Data\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.2\nThe University maintains personnel information for each employee in order to have a complete, accurate and current record of the employee's salary and job history at the University. This guide memo sets forth policies and procedures to facilitate the establishment, use and maintenance of personnel data, in whatever form maintained.\nApplicability:\nApplies to regular employees (as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions), Academic Staff - Research, and Academic Staff - Libraries. For policies that apply to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the agreements between Stanford University and SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and the Stanford University and the Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Association. Agreements can be found at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. \nWhile these policy statements are applicable to all University staff, the SLAC Human Resources Department maintains its own centralized personnel files and should be contacted for specific procedural information relating to personnel files for SLAC employees.\n1. Definition\nEmployee Personnel Files are defined to include the application for employment, and records which are used or have been used to determine an employee's qualifications for promotion, compensation, termination, or disciplinary action. A detailed list of appropriate contents is provided in Section 3.\n2. Location\nBecause of the decentralized personnel function at Stanford, the documents which form an employee's personnel file can be found (1) on computerized record-keeping systems and/or digital imaging systems, (2) locally in the Dean's, Director's, Vice Provost's or Vice President's office, (3) in the department head's or supervisor's office, (4) in the Payroll office, and/or (5) at the Personnel Records area at SLAC. All such documents comprise the personnel file.\n3. Contents\nEmployee personnel files should contain only that information which is directly related to the employee's job duties, salary, performance and general employment history. Medical files, where applicable, must be maintained separately from other files (see Guide to Supervisors on next page). Listed in the three following subsections are many types of documents which, if they exist, are appropriate for retention in employee personnel files. Documents that have not been shared with the employee and the supervisor do not belong in the file(s).\na. Personnel Files and Data Maintained by the Department/Division:\nAttendance and Absence Records (Note: At SLAC, these items are located in Payroll)\nFor areas that do not use PeopleSoft HRMS, and for periods of time that predate the implementation of PeopleSoft HRMS: \nLeave of absence correspondence (includes vacation and PTO)\nTime sheets: TTR, RHT, Hours Worked Record (SU-28); at SLAC, located in Payroll\nVacation and sick leave records; at SLAC, located in Payroll\nYearly leave records; at SLAC, located in Payroll\nOffer and/or confirmation of employment letters\nClassification review letters addressed to employee\nCopies of compliance agreements and other University-required agreements, such as HIPAA and those related to use of patents or confidential personnel information/data\nDisciplinary memos issued to employee\nI-9 documents and supporting documentation (SLAC)\nJob application and any attachments (resume, etc.)\nJob descriptions\nJob requisitions\nLayoff notice issued to employee\nPerformance evaluations issued to employee; employee responses thereto\nPersonnel action forms (PAF)\nPhoto ID where required (SLAC)\nResignation letter\nSTAP forms and related documents\nTermination notice issued to employee\nTransfer or promotion requests\nYears of applicable experience calculation\nb.

The following list provides some examples of the types of documents that should be retained, but separate from the personnel file.\nContact your local Human Resources office if you are ever in doubt of what to retain and/or where to retain it.\nAuxiliary medical files: \nDisability Claim Forms; SU-17: Accident/Injury Report\nPhysician evaluations\nCommunications from or to University attorneys\nEmployee settlement agreements\nEmployee lawsuits\nEmployee charges to outside agencies (EEOC, California CRD, OFCCP)\nEmployee Relations advice\nGrievances, grievance responses, and grievance-related documents\nMemos between management and the Compensation office\nPersonal financial information (loan applications)\nRecords relating to workplace investigations, including reports related to such investigations, with the exception of any corrective action issued to an employee as a result of an investigation\nLetters of reference\n4. Access and Use\nPersonnel files are confidential and access is limited to protect employee privacy. See:\nGuide Memo 1.1.1: University Code of Conduct, section 3\nGuide Memo 1.5.2: Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest, section 2.b and 2.e\nGuide Memo 6.1.1: Administrative Computing Systems, section 3.c\nGuide Memo 6.2.1: Computer and Network Usage Policy\nGuide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems, section 5\na. Access by the Employee or Representative\nEach employee or their authorized representative may review the employee’s own local personnel files by requesting an appointment with the local Human Resources office during regular business hours and non-working time. An employee or their authorized representative may review the employee’s own payroll and related forms by making an appointment with and presenting appropriate identification to the Payroll office. An authorized representative must present a written authorization signed by the employee permitting the representative to make such inspection. Such appointments generally will occur, unless agreed in writing, within 30 days after the written request for inspection is submitted.\nA Human Resources or Payroll staff member will remain present during the time the file is reviewed, allowing sufficient inspection time commensurate with the volume of the file. The employee or authorized representative is permitted to take notes during the inspection.\nAn employee or their authorized representative may also request a copy of the personnel file. The authorized representative must present written proof, signed by the employee, that the representative is authorized to receive a copy of the personnel file. Such a copy will be provided at the employee’s expense within 30 days after a written request is received from the employee or their authorized representative. Requests for a copy of payroll records, however, must be provided within 21 days of receipt of the employee’s request. Current employees can also access their payroll records, including W-2s and time and leave records, at any time in the Axess portal.\nb. Access by a Former Employee\nA former employee of the University or their authorized representative may request a copy of their personnel file for up to three years after termination. The request must be in writing, and the representative must provide written proof signed by the employee authorizing the representative to request and receive a copy of the personnel file. Generally such requests will be granted once each year and the copy provided within 30 days after receipt of the written request, unless the University and the employee (or authorized representative) agree otherwise. The copy of the file may be provided at the former employee's expense. Requests by a former employee for a copy of their payroll records must be provided within 21-days of receipt of the former employee’s request.\nc. Access by University Officials\nUniversity officers, managers, deans, department heads, Human Resources professionals, representatives of the General Counsel's office, and other University officials with a business need to do so may review individual files. This access is also extended to hiring officers within the University when the employee is a finalist for promotion or transfer.\nd. Access by Summons/Subpoenas\nProcess servers with summons or subpoenas for documents contained in an individual employee's personnel file should be directed to Payroll, or to the Manager of Employee & Labor Relations at SLAC. Departments are not authorized to accept service of summons or subpoenas.\ne. Outside Employment Verification Requests (Former and Current Employees)\nStanford does not respond directly to any employment verification requests. Stanford contracts with a third party service supplier to provide employment, salary, and immigration verification services. Employees should follow the instructions at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities for employment verification. Requests for information on SLAC employees should be referred to the SLAC Human Resources Department.\nf. Access by Agents of the University\nAgents of the University are required by contract to certify that University personnel data will be treated confidentially and only used for the purposes specified in the contract.\ng. Requests for Employment References (Former & Current Employees)\nRequests from outside the University for employment references should be directed to the local Human Resources office. Requests for information about SLAC employees should be referred to the SLAC Human Resources Department. Information other than the dates of employment and job classification requires the employee's written consent before the release of information.\n5. Maintenance and Retention\na. Current Employees\nAn employee's work history at Stanford may include service with many different departments. To streamline recordkeeping, the local personnel files should follow the employee from one department to the next, thereby creating a consolidated personnel file containing the employee's complete job history. Local personnel files must be kept in a secure location to prevent unauthorized access.\nNo one should be responsible for maintenance of their own personnel file or data. For example, the personnel file of a department or school's file administrator should be maintained by that individual's supervisor or manager, as appropriate.\nb. Terminated Employees\nThe final department where a former employee worked is responsible for ensuring that appropriate records are retained for the requisite length of time. Records of former Stanford employees should be retained for eight years following the date of termination.\nc. Destruction of Outdated Information\nPersonnel files contain confidential information and must be destroyed by shredding, incinerating or, in the case of digital records, purged by the system administrator. When the requisite period of data retention has passed, the records should be destroyed. Contact University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations or the SLAC Human Resources Department before the destruction or purging of any personnel information."}

The cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean, or designee should establish guidelines to ensure consistent application of this policy across their business unit. This policy is based on and in alignment with the expectations set forth by AGM 1.1.1: University Code of Conduct, specifically regarding employing sound business practices and exercising prudent financial management in the stewardship of university resources.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all faculty, academic staff, and regular staff as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions.\n1. Policy Statement\nSchools, departments, and other organizational units (business units) may use appropriate university funding sources to occasionally provide gifts, awards, or prizes to university employees to recognize non-performance-related activities. See Cardinal at Work for information on performance recognition. Each business unit decides who is eligible and what occasion warrants a gift. The cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean, or designee should establish guidelines to ensure consistent application of this policy across their business unit. Gifts may not be presented in place of payment for services. All gifts, awards, or prizes given to university employees are taxable income to the employee except for the following, and then only when given within the parameters detailed in the subsequent sections:\nTangible length of service/retirement awards\n‘De Minimis’ tangible gifts, awards, prizes, and sympathy gifts as defined in Section 3\nCash or cash equivalent items, which include all gift cards and gift certificates, are always taxable to the recipient regardless of the amount as required by IRS regulations.\n2. Tangible Length of Service/Retirement Awards\nA regular staff employee and an academic staff employee must be in active service on their anniversary date to receive the length-of-service award. Length of service is determined by computing the period of service as defined in Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations, Section 1.a. The value of the award should be proportionate to the number of years of service recognized (e.g., a 15-year service award is greater than the 10-year service award). Recognition should be made in five-year increments. \nTo commemorate length of service or retirement, an item or items of tangible personal property with a total value up to $400 can be given on a tax-free basis to an employee with at least five years of service. The value or cost of the length of service or retirement award should not exceed $400 during the taxable (calendar) year.Stanford-branded merchandise or other tangible items, including food, are recommended. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are taxable to the employee regardless of the amount. Learn more about employee gifts on Fingate’s Categories of Purchases.\nThe value of the award should be proportionate to the number of years of service recognized (e.g., a 15-year service award is greater than the 10-year service award). The award must be presented in a meaningful presentation or ceremony. Every attempt should be made to give a length of service/retirement award during the year the anniversary occurs. Business units must ensure that special presentation events are conducted only on an occasional basis and that the costs of these events are reasonable. Recognition should be made in five-year increments.\nIf the employee elects to retire the same year they become eligible for a length-of-service award, then the maximum total value or cost of the award(s) should not exceed $400 for the award(s) to be nontaxable. \nThe guidelines above also apply to faculty retirement awards. Faculty members do not participate in the five-year incremental length of service awards or the Stanford Celebrates You program.\nLength of service or retirement awards with a value over $400 will be taxable to the extent the value exceeds the dollar limit (e.g., if a $450 award is given, then $50 will be taxable).\n3. ‘De Minimis’ Tangible Gifts, Awards, Prizes, and Sympathy Gifts\na. Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nTangible items of personal property given to an employee as a gift, award or prize should not exceed an aggregate value over the course of a calendar year of more than $100 per individual. Gifts, awards, or prizes that are provided frequently to an employee, even in small amounts, are not considered de minimis. Stanford-branded merchandise or other tangible items, including food, are recommended. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are taxable to the employee regardless of the amount.\nDonated prizes or gifts used for a raffle drawing or door prize at an employee event must comply with the $100 per individual limit for the prize to be non-taxable to the employee.\nGifts with an aggregate value over $100 will be fully taxable (e.g., if several gifts which total to $150 are given over the course of a calendar year, then $150 will be taxable).\nb. Sympathy Gifts\nTangible items of personal property, such as flowers or fruit baskets, may be given to an employee to express sympathy when there is a death or serious illness of the employee’s close family member. The value of the gift should not exceed an aggregate value of $100. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are taxable to the employee regardless of the amount.\n4. Requesting Payment and Recording Value\nThe value of a gift, award, or prize may be paid personally and reimbursed by the university or purchased using a university Purchasing Card.\na. Non-taxable Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nThe employee’s name and the occasion for the gift (e.g., 10-year service) must be included in the transaction. \nb. Taxable Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nThe employee’s name, employee ID number, and occasion for the gift must be included in the transaction to allow for the value to be tax reported to the employee on their Form W-2.\n5. Employee Morale and Performance-based Awards\nThis policy does not discuss ordinary business expenses in the promotion of employee morale. Examples of such business expenses are occasional business lunches or office gatherings. For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses.\nThis policy does not discuss performance-based awards or bonuses, which are taxable to the recipient and processed through Payroll.\n6.

Overview\na. Background and Purpose\nThe University is separate and independent of Stanford Health Care (SHC). Each entity maintains its own Human Resources department, employment policies and employee benefits.\nThis Guide Memo explains when the hire date from Stanford Health Services (SHS), Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH), UCSF Stanford Health Care (USHC), or SHC will be used instead of the new University hire date for certain University benefits for eligible employees.\nb. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Guide Memo, the following definitions apply:\nEmployed - earning wages or on an approved leave of absence from a regular position eligible for health and welfare benefits with the applicable employer.\nSHS Hire Date - the actual date of hire at SHS.\nLPCH Hire Date - the later of January 17, 1997, or the actual date of hire at LPCH.\nUSHC Hire Date - the actual date of hire at USHC.\nSHC Hire Date - the actual date of hire at SHC.\n2. Eligibility Requirements\na. Eligible Employee\nAn eligible employee must have been employed by SHS, LPCH or the Stanford University School of Medicine on or before October 31, 1997, or must have been employed on or after April 1, 2000, by SHC (including employment by LPCH). The Tuition Grant Program benefits described in section 8 uses its own definition of Eligible Employee.\nb. Direct Change\nAn eligible employee must \"change directly\" to employment with the University. For purposes of this policy, a direct change occurs when the employee ceases employment with SHC on one business day and commences employment with the University on the next University business day.\n3. Pay Rate\nAn eligible employee who becomes a University employee receives a rate of pay consistent with the guidelines that apply to internal University transfers and promotions.\n4. Voluntary Change\nAn eligible employee who at their own discretion applies for and accepts University employment is considered to have made a voluntary change of employers. In such situations, the following criteria apply for benefits eligibility:\na.

This policy does not supersede more restrictive policies that may be in force to comply with federal, state, or local laws or ordinances. The President must approve more restrictive policies not required by law.\n1. Policy\nIt is the policy of Stanford University that all smoking, including but not limited to tobacco products and the use of electronic smoking devices, is prohibited in enclosed buildings and facilities and during indoor or outdoor events on the campus.\n2. Definition\n“Smoke-free” refers to an environment that is free of smoke from, among other things, tobacco products and/or vapors from electronic smoking devices.\n3. Guidelines\na. Smoking-Prohibited Areas\nSpecifically, smoking is prohibited in classrooms and offices, all enclosed buildings and facilities, in covered walkways, in University vehicles, during indoor or outdoor athletic events, during other University sponsored or designated indoor or outdoor events and in outdoor areas designated by signage as \"smoking prohibited\" areas.\nAshtrays will not be provided in any enclosed University building or facility.\n\"Smoking Prohibited\" signs will be posted.\nb. Outdoor Smoking Areas\nExcept where otherwise posted as a \"smoking prohibited area,\" smoking is generally permitted in outdoor areas, except during organized events. Outdoor smoking in non-prohibited areas must be at least 30 feet away from doorways, open windows, covered walkways, and ventilation systems to prevent smoke from entering enclosed buildings and facilities. To accommodate faculty, staff and students who smoke, Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts and Deans may designate certain areas of existing courtyards and patios as smoking areas, and must provide ashtrays. The specific academic or administrative unit(s) will be responsible for absorbing all costs associated with providing designated smoking areas and ashtrays.\n4. Enforcement\nThis policy relies on the consideration and cooperation of smokers and non-smokers. It is the responsibility of all members of the University community to observe and follow this policy and its guidelines.\na. Smoking Cessation Information\nSmoking cessation programs are available for faculty and staff through BeWell's Healthy Living offerings.

Implementation and Distribution\nThis policy will be disseminated to all faculty, staff and students and to all new members of the University Community."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/compensation-staff-employees","text":"2.1.5 Compensation of Staff Employees\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.4\nThis Guide Memo outlines Stanford University's compensation policies.\nApplicability:\nApplies to regular employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and Academic Staff-Libraries as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining for details. This policy also applies to:\nTemporary and casual employees, where specified\nSLAC, but implementation procedures may differ\nPolicy Statement:\nIt is Stanford University's policy to pay salaries that reflect the duties and responsibilities of the position and the scope and complexity of the work performed. This policy and Stanford’s compensation practices are designed to set pay that is competitive in the geographic region where work is performed and ensure that pay is managed in a consistent, equitable manner regardless of funding sources. It is also the intention of the university to set salary ranges that provide competitive pay comparable with relevant labor markets. Consistent with its obligations under the law, Stanford shall not discharge, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against, employees or applicants because they have discussed, inquired about, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant. For questions or further information, contact your local Human Resources office or University Human Resources Staff Compensation.\n1. Information Sources\nUniversity compensation policies and procedures for staff employees are described in this Guide Memo and these publications and memoranda:\nAnnual memoranda that describe the salary program, issued by the Vice President for Human Resources. These memoranda include current compensation policies and procedures, and salary structures that are reviewed and approved each year.\nTo find specific administrative information on the staff compensation program, policies, and salary structures, see the Compensation website.\n2. Hours of Work and Work Records\na. Workweek\nThe basic full-time workweek is 40 hours of work on five consecutive eight-hour days. The standard week is a seven-day period commencing at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ending at midnight the following Sunday. Salaried staff employed for a work week of less than the basic 40-hour week receive reduced salary based on the ratio of hours worked to 40 hours. Staff employees who are employed at an hourly rate are paid for the actual time worked.\nStraight time is time worked up to eight hours a day and 40 hours a week unless the employee is on an alternative work schedule (see section 6, Alternative Work Schedule).\nb. Nonstandard Workweek\nDepartments may establish other workweek schedules or work arrangements to meet their requirements, including a workweek that begins and ends on other days or hours than the basic workweek (outlined in section 3.a), if approved in advance by the local Human Resources office. See guidelines at Flexible Work Options.\nc. Make-Up Time\nAt the written request of the employee, and with the approval of the supervisor, a non-exempt employee may reduce their work hours for a personal obligation on one day and make up the hours not worked on another day during the same workweek. The employee may do this by working more than eight hours but not more than 11 hours in one day, with the understanding that no overtime premium will be paid unless the total number of hours worked in any one day exceeds 11 hours or the total number of hours worked in any one workweek exceeds 40.\nd. Day of Rest\nNon-exempt employees working more than 30 hours a week are entitled to have at least one day off in seven in compliance with California state law.\ne. Rest Breaks\nThe university provides non-exempt employees a 15-minute paid, duty-free rest break for each four hours of work or \"major fraction\" of four hours of work (i.e., more than two hours), provided the employees work at least three-and-one-half hours per day. Insofar as practicable, rest breaks should be scheduled in the middle of each work period. Rest breaks are duty-free time and employees are free to leave the premises, where practicable. Rest breaks should also be arranged so that disruptions of work and services are held to a minimum. Employees are not permitted to use their rest breaks to shorten the workday or to extend the meal period. If a non-exempt employee is not provided the required number of duty-free rest breaks in a day and/or is not relieved of all duty during their rest breaks, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate must be paid to the employee.\nf. Meal Periods\nMeal periods normally are for one hour and are unpaid. Time taken for meal periods is not part of the work day, provided the employee is relieved of all duty. A non-exempt employee must be provided with an unpaid meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than five hours of work, and a second meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than ten hours of work, unless the employee waives the right to the second meal period. A non-exempt employee who works no more than six hours in the workday may also waive the right to a meal period if the supervisor approves. Such waivers require the employee’s consent, can be revoked by the employee at any time, and are recommended to be in writing. Supervisors should consult with their local Human Resources office before agreeing to waive an employee’s meal period.\nIf a non-exempt employee is not provided with a 30-minute, duty-free meal period and/or is not relieved of all duty during a meal period, then the time must be recorded as work hours. Additionally, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate must be paid to the employee for any missed, late, or otherwise non-compliant meal period.\ng. Note to Supervisors\nUnpaid meal breaks, including actual start and stop times, must be recorded in each employee's Axess Timecard. If a meal break is not provided, a one-hour penalty must also be recorded.\nh. Work Records\n1. Records for Non-Exempt Employees\nFederal and state laws require non-exempt employees to keep an accurate daily record of hours actually worked, including actual start and stop times and meal breaks. Axess Timecard, in the human resources management system (HRMS) is the system of record to indicate hours worked, including overtime hours and vacation, sick, holiday and other leave time taken by each non-exempt employee. In the time-keeping system, records must be updated by the end of each pay period, but it is recommended that employees update their actual work hours each work day. Supervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve non-exempt employees' time records and must approve any variance from the employees' normally scheduled work hours.\nAlso see Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations, Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time, Guide Memo 2.1.8: Miscellaneous Authorized Absences, and Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays.\n2. Records for Exempt Employees\nAxess Timecard, in the human resources management system (HRMS), is the system of record to indicate vacation, sick and other leave time taken by each regular exempt employee. In that system, records must be updated by the end of each pay period. For exempt employees it is not necessary to report any vacation, PTO or Floating Holiday time less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours. Sick time may be taken in any increment. In the case of intermittent Family and Medical Leave, the local Human Resources office must be consulted to ensure that (a) accurate records are maintained of time used for Family and Medical Leave, and (b) the employee's leave balance is properly reduced for time charged to intermittent Family and Medical Leave. Supervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve exempt employees' leave records.\nAlso see Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations, Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time, Guide Memo 2.1.8: Miscellaneous Authorized Absences and Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays.\n3. Records for Non-Employees\nStanford is not required to keep a record of hours for consultants or employees of another employer with whom the university has a contract for service.\n3. Pay Administration\nThe Vice President for Human Resources administers the overall salary program, including establishing staff job classifications, maintaining location-based salary structures, and developing job-specific regional market pay ranges. University Human Resources Staff Compensation is responsible for providing guidance to local Human Resource Managers to ensure jobs are properly classified, and base pay is set appropriately and managed in a consistent, equitable manner. University Human Resources Staff Compensation proactively reviews and approves all pay actions for Remote employees to ensure pay is managed in alignment with the applicable salary structure and program guidelines, and is equitable with pay of Stanford employees in similar roles. The Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts, Deans and Directors are responsible for managing pay and classification actions in their area(s) in a manner consistent with this policy and compensation program guidelines. \na. Base Pay\nBase pay is set for each job based on market survey data and managed within the parameters established by the applicable salary structure. Pay for employees in On-site and Hybrid work arrangements and Remote employees who perform work within the 10-county area is set and managed based on the Stanford Work Location Salary Structure. Pay for remote employees who perform work working outside the 10-county area is set and managed based on one of the four Regional Salary Structures determined by the location where work is performed. See Guide Memo 2.1.21 for definitions of On-site, Hybrid, Remote, and 10-county area. Upon request to their supervisor or local Human Resources Manager, employees will be provided the pay range for their current position.\nb. Minimum Wage\nIn compliance with federal and state laws, employees must be paid the current minimum wage or higher unless a request for a specific exception is allowable under the law and approved by the Vice President for Human Resources. Information on the current minimum wage rate is available from University Human Resources Staff Compensation.\nc. Non-Cash Compensation\nWhen the university provides perquisites such as room, apartment, or meals, their value (as determined under tax laws) is added to cash compensation (and the employee’s regular rate of pay if required by law) to establish total base pay for computation of insured benefits. When required to be taken as a condition of employment, perquisites are not subject to federal income tax.\nd. Performance Increases\nStaff employees are eligible for pay increases based on performance. Pay increases are not automatic. Internal pay relationships and relevant market information are considered in setting pay increases.\n4. Overtime Compensation\na. Employees Exempt from Overtime Compensation\n(1) Definition of Exempt Employee\nCertain employees hold jobs that are exempt from governmental regulations regarding compensation for overtime work. In general, employees are exempt when employed in executive, administrative or learned, creative or computer professional positions as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act and California law. Exempt University employees are not entitled to receive overtime pay.\nThe Vice President for Human Resources or designee determines the exempt or non-exempt status of university classifications. Special circumstances, such as an employee working in more than one job (also referred to as a dual appointment) that may affect their exempt status, must be discussed with the local Human Resources office before hiring employees into additional jobs.\nNormal Expectations - Because of the many activities required to keep the university functioning, full-time members of the academic staff and regular exempt staff may be called upon to perform a variety of services for the institution apart from those normally considered to be their regular job duties. These staff members may be assigned these tasks either within their department or for another area within the university.\nFurther, it is understood that regular academic and exempt staff may often be expected to work in excess of 40 hours a week. Because these situations are considered to fall within the normal expectations for these staff, they would not constitute grounds for payment of additional compensation and the staff member would not receive payment in excess of 100% of the FTE salary.\nIf an employee receives a request to perform additional work for a department other than the employee's home department assignment (whether related or unrelated to the employee's current responsibilities), the employee must receive formal approval in advance from their supervisor or provide notification to the supervisor, depending on the duties:\nFor non-teaching duties, the employee must receive prior written approval from their current supervisor and the local Human Resources Office.\nFor teaching duties: \nIf the teaching duties occur outside the employee's normal work schedule, the employee must give prior written notification to their current supervisor and the local Human Resources office.\nIf preparation and/or teaching duties occur during the employee's normal work schedule, the employee must receive prior written approval from their current supervisor and the local Human Resources Office.\n(2) Further Information\nFor regular non-bargaining unit staff and academic staff-libraries, contact your Human Resources office.\nb. Overtime Entitlement\nAny employee holding a non-exempt job and who is required to work more than eight hours in a day, or more than 40 hours in a week, is entitled to compensation in accordance with (1) below. The total hours worked for one or more departments of the university are to be counted in determining overtime even though employment in any one department does not exceed the standard 8-hour day or 40-hour week. University policy provides for overtime payment for hours worked in excess of eight in one day in accordance with state regulations. University policy provides overtime payment for hours worked in excess of 40 in one week in accordance with state and federal regulations. Overtime policies are applicable to non-exempt temporary and/or casual employees as well as to regular non-exempt employees. University requirements and government regulations require that overtime hours worked by non-exempt employees be recorded and compensated.\n(1) Overtime Rate\nThe university's policy is to compensate non-exempt employees at a premium rate of one-and-one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay. For non-exempt employees, the regular rate is the weekly salary, including any applicable premiums required to be added by law, divided by regular, non-overtime hours worked. For non-exempt employees who are paid more than one hourly rate in a pay period, the overtime rate will be calculated based on the weighted average method. \nNon-exempt employees who work in excess of 12 hours per workday or in excess of eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a single work week will be compensated for those excess hours at the rate of twice their regular rate of pay.\nOvertime Rates: \nTime and one-half: hours eight through 12 in one workday\nDouble-time: hours after 12 in one workday\nTime and one-half: first eight hours on seventh consecutive workday\nDouble-time: after eight hours on seventh consecutive workday\nTime and one-half: after 40 hours in one work week, unless a double-time premium applies\n(2) Overtime Hours\nAuthorized paid time off (e.g., vacation, sick leave, personal time off, holidays, etc.) counts as time worked in determining if a non-exempt employee is entitled to overtime compensation. Leave without pay does not count as time worked.\n(3) Overtime Limitations\nOvertime work is to be kept to a minimum because of costs. Departments should permit overtime work by non-exempt employees only when it is essential to the operation of the department. State law prohibits persons under age 18 from working more than eight hours per day under any circumstances.\n(4) Approval of Overtime Work\nOvertime work by non-exempt employees requires approval in advance by the department head or a designated representative who has the authority to schedule work and approve overtime compensation. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to schedule or approve overtime work for themselves. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to work unpaid overtime. In circumstances where a part-time employee plans to work in more than one job for the same or other department(s), the employee’s supervisors should contact the local Human Resources office for consultation on both topics before implementation. In the event an employee works overtime without obtaining the prior approval of their supervisor, the overtime hours must be paid, but the failure of the employee to follow this provision can be addressed through corrective action.\n(5) Approval of Extended Overtime\nDepartments finding it necessary to schedule overtime for one or more employees on a regular basis for six months or longer as the only means of meeting work requirements, must obtain approval in advance from the appropriate Vice President or Vice Provost.\n5. Alternative Work Schedule\na. Definition\n\"Alternative work week\" refers to a schedule that allows non-exempt employees to work a standard work week (40 hours) that is condensed into fewer than five full days. A common alternative work week schedule is four 10-hour days.\nb. Guidelines\nGuidelines for Flexible Work Options.\nc. Administrative Considerations\nManagers should consider their operational needs before implementing an alternative work schedule. For example, an alternative work schedule may be used in the academic departments where expanded service hours are needed to accommodate client needs during irregular hours (e.g., students or clients in other time zones), but may be impractical when 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. coverage is the priority.\nd. Alternative Work Schedule Election\nUpon secret ballot election by affected employees conducted in strict compliance with applicable laws, and with the concurrence of management, non-exempt employees may work an \"alternative work week,\" such as four 10-hour work days, with the understanding that no overtime premium will be due unless the employee works more than 40 hours in any one week, or the supervisor compels the employee to work more than the agreed upon hours in any work day. No alternative work schedule for non-exempt employees may be implemented unless it meets all legal requirements and prerequisites and is reviewed in advance by Employee & Labor Relations in University Human Resources. Contact your local Human Resources office if you are interested in exploring the option of implementing an alternative work schedule, or consult with Employee & Labor Relations and review these guidelines for alternative work schedules or flexible work options.\n6. Special Compensation Situations for Non-Exempt Employees\na. Call-Back Time\n\"Call-back\" time occurs when a non-exempt employee responds to an emergency call and returns to work outside their normal working hours without advance notice. The minimum compensation for \"call-back\" time is two hours pay. Compensation for \"call-back\" time includes all hours worked, including the actual time spent traveling to and from the \"call-back\" duty.\nb. Standby and Beeper Pay\nEmployees away from work may be required to remain accessible for consultation or to return to work. Non-exempt employees assigned such duties are eligible to receive partial salary for the duration of the assignment depending on the extent to which that assignment restricts their personal activities.\n(1) Beeper Pay\nIf that restriction is limited to carrying a \"beeper,\" cell phone or similar device, and remain within range of the device, and be required to return any beeper page or call within 20 minutes, the partial salary is 5% of the employee's base pay for hours assigned to beeper duty, but not at work (called \"beeper pay\"). Any time spent by the employee answering pages or calls or returning to work is compensable at the employee’s base rate of pay or overtime regular rate, as applicable.\n(2) Standby Pay\nIf the restriction is narrower than discussed in (1) above, and the assignment requires the employee to be prepared to return instantly to return to work, the partial salary is 50% of the employee's base pay (which must be at least the minimum wage) for hours assigned to standby duty, but not at work (called \"standby pay\"). \nc. Shift Pay\nShift premiums are paid to non-exempt full-time employees assigned to shifts other than daytime schedules. Non-exempt employees working full-time and assigned to swing shifts (shifts starting between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m.) will be paid a 10% shift premium. Non-exempt employees working full-time and assigned to owl/night shifts (shifts starting between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.) will be paid a 15% shift premium. \nNon-exempt employees who work swing shifts or owl/night shifts for their own convenience rather than to meet operational needs shall be considered to be assigned to daytime schedules and paid their normal hourly rate regardless of when the hours are actually worked.\nThis shift pay provision does not apply to sworn officers in the Department of Public Safety.\n7. Temporary Compensation for Work in a Higher Classification\nAdditional temporary compensation may be appropriate when an employee temporarily fills a position at a higher classification for two or more consecutive months, but typically no longer than six months, subject to additional considerations. The employee retains their classification and exempt or non-exempt status during the temporary assignment. In addition, non-exempt employees may be entitled to overtime compensation consistent with the sections in this Guide Memo. For questions or further information or assistance in determining the appropriate temporary compensation amount, contact University Human Resources, Staff Compensation."}

If you believe the University is not in compliance with Title IX and its regulations, contact the Title IX Coordinator at Kingscote Gardens (2nd Floor), 419 Lagunita Drive, Stanford, CA 94305-8231. Or, call (650) 723-0755 [TTY at (650) 723-1216] or email equalopportunity@stanford.edu.\nb. Employment Rights and Preferences of Former and Current Regular Staff\nThe University gives current and former regular staff certain reemployment rights and preferences described below:\n(1) Right to Reemployment or Return to Active Employment\n(a) Definition\nThe right of a former regular staff to reemployment or return to active employment in their former University position to the extent required by law.\n(b) Who Qualifies\nReemployment rights extend to former regular staff who:\nTerminated employment to serve in the military. A department that receives an inquiry about reemployment of a former employee returning from the Armed Services should consult with an Employee Relations Representative.\nReturns from a leave of absence on or before the agreed upon return date (e.g., military, childbirth, family, medical) when the leave was formally requested and granted in accordance with University policy.\n(2) Hiring Preference\nThe University is committed to hiring the best qualified candidate for the job. When the qualifications stated in the job listing and predetermined job-related selection criteria are used to determine each candidate's qualifications, and more than one qualified candidate competes for a job, the employment offer must be extended first to the candidate who has preference according to 2.b.3 below.\n(3) Order of preference\nFollow this order when considering substantially equal candidates:\n(a) First Preference:\nRegular staff who have been given written notice of permanent layoff or who are permanently laid off under the policies in Guide Memo 2.1.17: Layoffs. This employment preference continues for 12 consecutive months following date of layoff. Layoff preference also applies to regular staff whose positions are being eliminated and who have been informed that they will be laid off if they do not obtain alternative employment in the same department/administrative unit.\n(b) Second Preference:\nCurrent regular staff who meet the qualifications for the position and for whom placement in this job would constitute a promotion, or who have successfully completed a formal training program for the specific job.\n(c) Third Preference:\nCurrent temporary or casual employees on the Stanford payroll applying for a position in the same work group reporting to the same supervisor where the employee currently works in a temporary or casual role.\nGuide to Supervisors\nPolicy conflicts may occur between consideration of the hiring preferences and consideration of affirmative action goals. In these circumstances, consult with the local Human Resources Office before making an offer of employment.\nc. Employment of Related Persons\nEmployment by a related person in any position (e.g., regular staff, faculty, other teaching, temporary, casual, third party, etc.) within an organizational unit can occur only with the approval of the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest administrative person within the organizational unit), or their designee. Under no circumstances may a supervisor hire or approve any compensation action for any employee to whom the supervisor is related. An individual may not supervise, evaluate the job performance, or approve compensation for any individual with whom the supervisor is related.\nEven when the criteria discussed here are met, employment of a related person in any position within the organization must have the approval of the local human resources office, in addition to the approval of the hiring manager's supervisor, including faculty supervisors. \nGuide to Supervisors\nEmployment by a related person in any position (e.g., regular staff, faculty, other teaching, temporary, casual, third party, etc.) within an organizational unit can result in an actual or perceived conflict of interest and is strongly discouraged.\nThe university recognizes that relationships may develop in the workplace. The university expects its employees to disclose relationships as appropriate, and specifically in the case of direct reporting relationships and/or potential conflict of interest situations. Failure to properly disclose a relationship or family connection may lead to corrective action measures being taken.\nAll of the above requirements also apply to employing and hiring those with consensual sexual or romantic relationships. In addition, consensual sexual or romantic relationships must also be disclosed in compliance with section 4 in Guide Memo 1.7.2: Consensual Sexual or Romantic Relationships In the Workplace and Educational Setting.\nDefinition of Related Person - The employee’s spouse; same-sex domestic partner; children of the employee, spouse or same-sex domestic partner; parents and parents-in-law; parent surrogate; brothers and sisters of the employee; grandparents and grandchildren of the employee; and, any other dependent family member who lived in the employee’s residence.\nd. Rehiring Former Regular Staff\nRegardless of the reason for rehire, all former staff must serve a new Trial Period, including those former staff who meet the reinstatement criteria set forth below.\n(1) Reinstating the Hire Date:\nFormer regular staff will have their hire date reinstated if they left the University in good standing and meet these timelines:\nFormer regular staff who has been laid off and is reemployed by the University within 24 months following the date of layoff will have the most recent hire date prior to layoff reinstated.\nFormer regular staff whose employment was terminated for reasons other than layoff will have the most recent date of hire prior to termination reinstated if reemployment occurs within 12 months following the date of termination. Reinstatement includes all of the following:\nBridging of service by restoring the most recent hire date in a benefits-eligible position before termination,\nRestoration of any sick leave balance at the time of termination, and\nVacation accrual rate based on the reinstated hire date.\n(2) Rehire After Involuntary Discharge\nIf a regular staff member was terminated from the University for cause, supervisors must consult their local HR Office and Employee Relations Representative before rehire or reinstatement. An individual who was terminated for gross misconduct is not eligible for rehire.\nGuide to Supervisors\nFor information on how rehire or reinstatement affects benefits, visit the Cardinal at Work website or contact the University HR Service Team.\nHiring Hospital Employees - See Guide Memo 2.1.4: Hiring Employees from Stanford Health Care or its Predecessor Companies for information on applicability of University employment policies and eligibility for University benefits when hiring regular staff who was previously employed by Stanford Health Care (or its predecessor companies) or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital.\ne. Age as a Hiring Factor\nAge (except for persons under 18 who have not graduated from high school) may not be used as a factor in hiring unless it can be shown as a necessary job qualification.\nf. Employment of Minors\nBefore an offer of employment is made, the hiring department must obtain a work permit for applicants under age 18 years who have not graduated from high school. A permit is obtained from the applicant's school district and is retained in the department file.\nGuide to Supervisors\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California law restricts the hours and conditions of employment for minors. Because restrictions on the employment of minors can be complex, supervisors should consult with their local Human Resources Office about specific cases. General restrictions include:\nExcept as part of approved University programs (e.g., Take Our Children to Work Day), minors are not permitted to visit in areas where they would not be permitted to work as employees.\nMinors ages 16-17: In addition to the above, prohibited from working on hazardous jobs. No other restrictions.\nMinors ages 14-15: In addition to all the above, during school session, cannot work more than 3 hours/day, 18 hours/week. During school vacation, cannot work more than 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week.\nMinors under age 14: In addition to all the above, prohibited from most non-agricultural work.\n3. Policies and Practices—Search Phase\na. Job Descriptions\nBefore a job description is entered into the HR Applicant Tracking system:\n(1) Hiring supervisor's responsibilities:\nIdentify the functions of the job, define and describe the duties and responsibilities of the position, include required regulatory training, develop and document objective criteria for the selection process, and obtain local Human Resources Office's confirmation of position level and salary range. For guidance, visit Staff Compensation. Qualifications cannot unnecessarily prevent or lessen the employment opportunities for any class of applicants or potential applicants, as identified in Section 2.b.\n(2) Local Human Resources Office's responsibilities:\nReviews the Position Summary for clarity and content, classification and salary range, and ensures that the job description is entered into the HR Applicant Tracking system. The job requisition is also reviewed for appropriateness of posting. All job postings must include the pay range for the position. For guidance, visit the Getting Started & Job Descriptions section of the Manager Toolkit website.\nGuide to Supervisors\nSelection Criteria - Use the job description and other relevant criteria established by the hiring supervisor (including education, experience, essential skills, abilities and competencies) to screen applicants and aid in the selection process.\nb. Announcing Job Openings\n(1) Local Human Resources Offices\nAll regular staff vacancies must be listed with the appropriate Human Resource office.\nFor SLAC, SLAC Human Resources Department.\nFor campus, University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy announces all openings on Stanford Careers and may use other media as appropriate.\n(2) Temporary Employment\nNon-regular staff vacancies that do not lend themselves to employment of Stanford students due to the nature of the work and work schedule, may be listed with commercial temporary employment services and/or Cardinal Temps.\n(3) Text of Advertisements\nAdvertising and other notification of vacancies must be non-discriminatory and must include reference to the University's commitment to affirmative action and equal opportunity: “Stanford is an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.”\nc. Posting Period\n(1) Definition\nA posting period is the period during which information about the job opening is made available and applications are accepted. Generally, postings should not exceed six months except where the hiring supervisor is actively seeking and reviewing applications for the position.\n(2) Length of Posting Period\nAll vacant positions except those filled through an approved posting period waiver (see Section 3.d for information on waivers) are posted online for a minimum of 10 calendar days. The posting period begins when the approved online requisition updates the Applicant Tracking system. Applications are accepted through the full posting period. If a job code changes on a posted vacant position, it must be reposted online for a minimum of 10 additional calendar days. \n(3) Changes in Posting Period\nPosting periods may not be shortened or eliminated except through the waiver process (see Section 3.d). Posting periods may be extended at the hiring supervisor's discretion and applications may be accepted beyond the posting period at the supervisor's discretion.\n(4) Timing of Employment Offer\nOffers of employment may not be made until after the expiration of the posting period or an approved waiver of posting (see Section 3.d).\nd. Waiver of Posting\nAll regular staff vacancies not posted for the minimum posting period must have an approved waiver of posting before an employment offer can be made. Waiver requests are reviewed and approved by University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy.\n(1) Affirmative Action Goals\nWaivers are not available for positions that fall within EEO job categories for which Stanford has an affirmative action goal.\n(2) Approval Criteria\nThe hiring department must document the reason for requesting the waiver. The local Human Resources office must submit the waiver request to University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy. University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy may approve the waiver request if it meets at least one of the following criteria:\nThe department documents critical operational need, or\nThere is a uniquely qualified/skilled applicant and it is unlikely a better qualified candidate would apply, or\nThe department is reusing a recent (within past six months) applicant pool for a comparable job likely to result in a similar pool.\n(3) Denial Criteria\nUniversity Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy may deny a waiver request if it is determined that the requested action would be inconsistent with the University’s waiver or affirmative action policies.\ne. Recruitment of Applicants\n(1) Definition of an Applicant\nCurrently Stanford requires resumes for regular staff positions to be submitted through the Stanford Careers (or Jobs@SLAC) website. Consistent with this requirement, an applicant is defined as any person who meets all of these criteria:\nThe individual submits a resume for a specific position through the Stanford Careers (or Jobs@SLAC) website,\nStanford considers the individual for employment in a particular position,\nThe individual's resume indicates the individual possesses the basic qualifications for the position, and\nThe individual at no time during the selection process prior to receiving an offer of employment removes him/herself from further consideration or otherwise indicates that their is no longer interested in the position.\n(2) Equal Opportunity Policy\nWith the assistance of University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy and the local Human Resources Office, departments must make every effort to recruit qualified individuals for job openings, keeping in mind the university's commitment to equal opportunity and affirmative action, and any specific affirmative action goals (as opposed to quotas or preferences, which may not be used) established for specific classifications and departments.\n(3) International Recruitment\nPlease review Section 6, International Hiring, before recruiting or hiring outside of the United States.\n(4) Search Firms\nIn general, Stanford makes limited use of the services of executive search firms or employment agencies. In the instances where it is necessary to use such services (e.g., senior level vacancies), departments must consult with the local Human Resources Office before making any arrangement with an outside firm or agency.\nGuide to Supervisors\nThe hiring supervisor is accountable for assuring that the firm or agency is fully informed with regard to its responsibility for meeting the University’s institutional affirmative action and record keeping responsibilities. Consultation on search firms is available from University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy.\nFor a checklist on how to choose a search firm that meets Stanford’s requirements to provide a widely diverse selection of applicants and the ability to track the applicant pool, go to the University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy website.\nReceiving Electronic Resumes—Electronic resumes are submitted to University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy using Stanford Careers. University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy will send applications a written acknowledgement that their resume has been received. Electronic resumes are submitted to SLAC using Careers at SLAC. \n4. Policies and Practices—Selection Phase\na. Employment Application Form\nAll interviewed applicants must complete and sign a Stanford University application form.\nStanford does not accept incomplete application forms.\nRetain a copy of all application forms with the appropriate search documentation.\nThe successful candidate’s application form must be retained in the personnel file (see Guide Memo 2.1.3: Personnel Files and Data).\nb. International Candidates\nPlease review Section 6, International Hiring, before selecting an international candidate.\nc. Interviews\n(1) Standard Administration\nHiring supervisors must ensure standard administration of the interview process, including the equivalent treatment of candidates, avoidance of discriminatory questions and uniform interview content.\n(2) Accommodation\nAt the request of a disabled candidate, accommodation during the interview process may be required.\nd. Testing\n(1) Prior Approval\nAll testing or screening devices used in the employment process must be approved by the AVP, Recruitment & Talent Management in consultation with the Diversity & Access Office, as appropriate. Only standardized, validated test instruments may be considered.\n(2) Accommodations\nAt the request of a disabled applicant, accommodation to enable testing may be required.\n(3) Applicability of Test\nWhen used, approved tests must directly relate to essential job functions and be given to all applicants or finalists under the same or equivalent conditions. The test must be scored, evaluated and used as a selection factor equally for all applicants or finalists and maintained with other applications and selection materials.\ne. Reference Checks\nThe hiring supervisor is required to obtain a minimum of two reference checks from previous employers, at least one of which is a current or prior supervisor. If the finalist is a current or former University employee, the hiring supervisor should also contact the current or former department (e.g., supervisor and/or Human Resources Manager). Reference checks must be part of the candidate’s evaluation and may be used as a factor in the hiring decision if the information is job-related. No offer of employment can be made before completing the hiring process, including reference checks.\nGuide to Supervisors\nThe hiring supervisor must exercise caution to assure that:\nThe names of those contacted for references are retained in the search documentation with any unsolicited written references provided by the candidate,\nInconsistent or negative information obtained in a reference check is corroborated, if possible, before it is used in making a hiring decision, and\nReference information used in the hiring decision is job-related and can be shown to be a predictor of job performance.\nLocal Human Resources Offices may provide consultation.\nf. False and/or Misleading Statements\nWithdraw from consideration any applicant found to have misleading and/or false statements on the employment application or other documents.\ng. Review of Personnel Files\nHiring supervisors have access to personnel files of current and former University employees who are finalists for the position. No offer of employment can be made before the hiring supervisor or Human Resources reviews the personnel files.\nGuide to Supervisors\nContact the local Human Resources Office for details and assistance (see Guide Memo 2.1.3: Personnel Files and Data).\n5. Hiring Decisions, Offers and Documentation\na. Hiring Decisions\nHiring decisions for regular University staff positions are based on the relative job-related qualifications of the applicants for the positions, with full consideration of the employment rights and preferences specified in Section 2.b.\nThe hiring supervisor is responsible for judging the relative qualifications of each applicant and for making the hiring decision, consistent with University policy and applicable governmental laws and regulations.\nThe local Human Resources Office is responsible for reviewing proposed hiring decisions and for ensuring compliance with regulations, laws, and/or University employment policies.\nThe Diversity & Access Office, if notified by an applicant or administrator regarding a particular opening, may delay a proposed hiring action for further review if it appears inconsistent with the University's Affirmative Action Program.\nb. Employment Offers\n(1) Timing of Offer\nEmployment offers should be made after:\nThe expiration of the posting period (or, after approval of a waiver request), and\nThe employment action (including in-hire salary) has received all required approvals.\n(2) Conditional Offer of Employment\nA written conditional offer of employment must be issued by the hiring department to the successful candidate using an approved offer letter template. Approved templates include those for standard hires, promotions and out-of-country hires. If a background check is required by policy, the written conditional offer of employment will inform the candidate that the offer is contingent upon successfully completing and passing a background check.\nGuide to Supervisors\nWorkplace Accommodation - At the request of a candidate or applicant who has a disability, workplace accommodation may be needed. The hiring supervisor should refer to Guide Memo 2.2.7: Requesting Workplace Accommodations for Employees with Disabilities.\nOut-of-Country - If this is an offer of employment for the applicant to work in a primary site outside the U.S., Staffing Services will assist the local Human Resources Office with arrangements. See Section 6 for details on International Hiring.\nc. Background Checks\nStanford policy requires successful completion of a background check before the first day of employment. Additional background checking may be required in some job classifications (e.g., Deputy Sheriffs). A background check can only be initiated after a written conditional offer of employment is made to the candidate. Local Human Resources Offices will provide information on specific requirements.\nd. Criminal Records\nA criminal record will not automatically disqualify a candidate from employment with the university. University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations will conduct an individualized assessment of any criminal record revealed during the background check process. If individual circumstances warrant, a candidate with a criminal record may be disqualified from employment.\ne. Documentation and Record Keeping\n(1) Pre-Employment\nNew, transferred, rehired or promoted employees may not start work in the new position until all appropriate forms have been signed and processed.\n(2) Non-Selected Applicants\nThe hiring supervisor is responsible for oral or written notification to all non-selected applicants who were interviewed.\nThe hiring supervisor must ensure that all search summary records are completed, including indication of all applicants' status (disposition data) in the HR Applicant Tracking system. For more information, see the University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy website.\n(3) Completeness\nRecords must include the resume and application materials of all applicants for a position, as well as documents pertaining to individuals considered for the position.\n(4) Patent and Copyright Agreement\nAll employees must complete a Patent and Copyright Agreement Form (SU18) as a condition of employment.\n(5) Retention Time\nThe hiring department must retain records relating to a search, selection and employment decision for a minimum of four years following the decision. Should there be a dispute (grievance/litigation), the documents must be retained until the matter is resolved, if not resolved by the conclusion of the four-year period.\n(6) More Information\nFor more information, see the University Human Resources: Talent Management & Workforce Strategy website.\n6. International Hiring\nHiring, transfer or assignment of regular staff outside of the United States\nmust be supported by a demonstrable University business purpose, and approved in writing by the cognizant School Dean or VP. Copies of such approvals should be forwarded to the Global HR Programs Manager in University Human Resources and the Global Business Director in Business Affairs.\nEmployees assigned or working outside of the United States\nare subject to local law as well as University policy and procedures when not in conflict with local law.\nGuide to Supervisors\nEmployment Options - Employment regulations in other countries may be very different than the U.S. In light of operational and regulatory complexities, careful consideration should be given to the various employment options in satisfaction of programmatic requirements, before considering an international hire, transfer or assignment.\nConsult with your HR Manager, and ask for a copy of the International Human Resources Checklist for Stanford University Human Resources Managers.\nSee Plan Global Activities\nFor additional guidance, consult Global Business Services (GBS) who can direct you to the cognizant central oversight office\nSee Administrative Guide Memo 11.2.22 International Employees.\nAdministrative Costs - Assignments outside of the United States typically involve significant additional administrative costs in light of the regulatory and operational complexity involved in such assignments. Accordingly, the supervisor hiring or assigning the employee outside of the United States is responsible for ensuring that the added administrative expense of such an assignment is covered by the applicable budget for the duration of the assignment.\nWork Authorization - Work authorization and immigration issues may require significant lead-time, and HR managers are responsible for ensuring that appropriate documents are secured prior to foreign employment. The local Human Resources Office cannot process an assignment until the proper work authorization is obtained. All offer letters must be approved by the local Human Resources Office in consultation with the Global HR Programs Manager.\nConsulting Arrangements - It should be noted with caution that what may appear to be a consulting arrangement by U.S. standards, could in fact constitute an employment relationship in a foreign country, potentially triggering employment, tax and other regulatory considerations.\nIn general, the same policies and practices are required for international hires as detailed in the ensuing guidelines for U.S. employment. However, local country norms and requirements take precedence, and it is the responsibility of local HR managers and the supervisor to ensure that the employee is apprised of such requirements prior to the effective date of the assignment. Assignments should be of a limited duration for the purpose of addressing tax, expatriate status and visa considerations.\nAdditional guidance may be obtained from the Global HR Programs Manager at globalhrprograms@stanford.edu in University Human Resources and/or the Global Business Director in Business Affairs."}

For purposes of this Guide Memo, all these types of employees will be referred to as \"regular staff employee(s).\"\nFor policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. Procedures for SLAC employees may vary.\n1. Accrual\na. Eligibility\nRegular staff employees of the University delineated in the Applicability section above accrue and use sick time as described below.\nb. Accrual of Sick Time\nRegular staff employees accrue sick time as follows:\nExempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of 8 hours per month of full-time pay.\nNon-exempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of .046154 hours per hour of straight time. This equates to 96 hours or 12 days a year in an average year of 2,080 straight time hours.\nFor part-time and part-month employment, sick time is credited on a prorated basis for any month a regular staff employee receives any straight-time pay. Straight-time pay for this purpose includes both straight-time pay for work performed and pay for holidays, vacation and sick. Accrual for an exempt regular staff employee who is employed part-time or part-month is based on the proportion of the regular staff employee with 100% FTE.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year-to-year, with no maximum limit.\nWhen changing positions: When a regular staff employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their sick time. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding sick time, including policies regarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals. If a regular staff employee's acceptance of a new position results in a limit on sick time accruals due to the policy applicable to the new position, any sick time in excess of the limit will be returned to the employee's accruals if the employee returns to a regular staff employee position consistent with the service bridging timelines set out in Section 2 of Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting & Hiring of Regular Staff.\nNo advance: Sick time must be accrued before it can be used.\nDuring temporary layoff, sick time accrues as if the laid-off regular staff employee continued to work regular time. (For more information, see Section 2 of Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.17: Layoffs).\nIf a regular staff employee separates from the University in good standing and is rehired by the University into a regular staff employee position within 12 months from the date of separation, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated. In the case of a layoff, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated if the regular staff employee is rehired into a regular staff employee position within 24 months from the date of layoff. (For more information about the University's policy regarding bridging of service, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting & Hiring of Regular Staff.)\nSick time shall not be paid out upon separation of employment.\nA maximum of 40 hours or five scheduled workdays of protected sick time use per year, whichever is greater, may be used pursuant to the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522 and Senate Bill 616. After this amount of sick time has been used, regular staff employees may use remaining sick time pursuant to this Guide Memo 2.1.7, and the remaining sick time is not subject to the protections of the California Paid Sick Leave Law.\nc. No Sick Time Accrues\nNo sick time accrues during periods of leave with or without pay beginning 8/1/05 or later, including short-term disability, long-term disability, worker's compensation and family temporary disability wage replacement (FTD).\nNo sick time accrues during a laid off or retiring regular staff employee's use of terminal vacation. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations.)\n2. Acceptable and Unacceptable Uses of Sick Time\na. Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a regular staff employee's illness or injury prevents the regular staff employee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments. Medical and dental appointments may also be charged to vacation, PTO or floating holiday. Medical and dental appointments include:\nDiagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventive care\nAppointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault or Stalking\nSick time may be used by a regular staff employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking in order to:\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, restraining order or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety or welfare of the victim or their child\nSeek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking\nObtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking\nObtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking\nParticipate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, including a temporary or permanent relocation\nd. University Holidays and Sick Time\nFor holidays that occur on days when a regular staff employee's absence due to illness/injury is fully charged to sick time, and the regular staff employee is not on other leave status, the time off is charged as a paid holiday.\ne. During Vacation\nWhen a regular staff employee is hospitalized or confined to bed by medical direction while on vacation, the time of hospitalization/confinement should be charged to accrued sick time. If appropriate, a claim should be submitted for disability plan benefits. (For instructions about submitting a disability claim, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\nf. During Winter Closure\nIf a regular staff employee has to use vacation, PTO or floating holiday for certain days during Winter Closure, accrued sick time may be used instead but only in the following limited circumstances:\nSick time may be used for days during Winter Closure that occur within an approved medical leave period, provided the regular staff employee was on the approved medical leave immediately prior to Winter Closure.\nSick time may be used for days during Winter Closure for which Lincoln Financial approved or approves disability or family temporary disability payments and for which days the regular staff employee needs to use paid sick time in order to maintain base pay. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\ng. Family Sick Time\n(1) Family Sick Time\nRegular staff employees may use a maximum of 15 sick days during a calendar year of service (January 1 to December 31) for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a regular staff employee's family member. For the purpose of this policy, family member includes, as the terms below are defined by law, only the regular staff employee's:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the regular staff employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the regular staff employees stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child's age or dependency status\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a regular staff employee or the regular staff employee's spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the regular staff employee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\n(2) \nRegular staff employees may use up to 3 days out of the maximum of 15 available family sick days for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a designated person. “Designated person” means a person identified by the regular staff employee at the time the regular staff employee requests paid sick days. A regular staff employee is limited to one “designated person” per 12-month period for such paid sick days.\n(3) \nRegular staff employees may also apply for family sick leave. (For instructions about submitting a family sick leave claim, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\nh. Use of Sick Time to Maintain Pay during Disability\nUnless the regular staff employee applies to their department in writing for an exception, which is approved, the university uses a regular staff employee's accrued sick time to maintain the regular staff employee's base pay during times when the regular staff employee is receiving disability benefits payments. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\nj. Unacceptable Use of Sick Time:\nUnless otherwise specifically allowed by this Guide Memo 2.1.7, sick time may only be used for an absence that a regular staff employee has during scheduled work hours.\n3. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe regular staff employee reports the absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how regular staff employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the regular staff employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the regular staff employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. Regular staff employees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department. Where flexible schedules are possible for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a regular staff employee's work hours.\nb. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use\nThe University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to record sick time credited, used and accumulated for all regular staff employees. Records must be updated each pay period for all employees who used sick time. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees. For information about Axess see the Time & Leave System overview.)\nc. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service. An adjustment is made at the beginning of the following month when the actual accrual is different than anticipated.\nd. Tax Status\nSick time is taxable income. Federal, state, and FICA taxes are deducted.\ne. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a regular staff employee's use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a regular staff employee's failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met. The University may request supporting documentation for any sick leave used in excess of 40 hours (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) per year of employment.\n(2) Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time\nIf the University has reasonable basis to believe that a regular staff employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a regular staff employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable Medical Evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner's statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when a regular staff employee is released to return to work.\nf. Applying for Disability\nA regular staff employee must apply for disability benefits if using sick time for more than 5 consecutive working or 7 consecutive calendar days for the same illness or injury."}

Policy\nWith the exception of Trial Period and Senior Staff, employees cannot be terminated without some form of cause as defined in Guide Memo 2.1.16. A supervisor must consult with the local Human Resources Office before the decision to discharge an employee, and cannot finalize the discharge decision without the concurrence of their next level manager and review and approval by the Office of the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee.\n(1) Notice\nDischarged employees receive two weeks' notice, pay in lieu of notice, or a combination of pay and notice, except in any of these circumstances:\nGross misconduct. Employees discharged for gross misconduct do not qualify to become an Official University Retiree, see Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement.\nFacts that lead the University to conclude the employee has abandoned the job.\nFailure or inability of the employee to return to work at the end of an authorized absence, e.g., temporary layoff, leave of absence or vacation.\nOther unauthorized absence from work.\n(2) Grievance Policy Applies\nA termination resulting from conduct and/or performance issue is considered a discharge for cause and subject to Guide Memo 2.1.11: Grievance Policy."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/miscellaneous-authorized-absences","text":"2.1.8 Miscellaneous Authorized Absences | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.7\nThis policy summarizes absences, paid and unpaid, approved by the university.\nApplicability:\nExcept as otherwise specified, applies to all regular employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time: Regular Staff Employees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians. For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining.\n1. Paid Absences\nPaid absences approved in advance count as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime payment [refer to Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees, section 5.b(3)]. The university authorizes these absences: Vacations in Guide Memo 2.1.6, Sick Time in Guide Memo 2.1.7, and Paid Holidays in Guide Memo 2.1.13. In addition, the following absences with continuation of pay are authorized by the university:\na. Voting\nWhen a regular full-time employee, because of the work schedule, is not able to vote outside of regularly scheduled work hours, supervisors shall authorize necessary time off, but not to exceed two hours with pay. Such time off should be scheduled when least disruptive to the department's work.\nb. Jury Duty\nA regular employee summoned to jury duty receives time off with pay for the periods of absence from scheduled work as required by the court. The employee retains any payments received from the court. The employee must provide verification from the court or jury commissioner of time spent on required jury duty.\nc. Court Appearances\nA regular employee subpoenaed as a witness in a non-work-related matter receives time off with pay for the periods of absence from scheduled work as required by the court.\nAbsences to appear as a plaintiff or defendant in a non-work-related matter should be charged to personal time off, vacation leave, or personal leave without pay.\nd. Personal Time Off\n(1) Use of Personal Time Off\nA regular employee may take time off from scheduled work for personal reasons with the supervisor's prior approval. An appropriate use of available Personal Time Off (PTO) is to continue pay during winter close. A full-time employee may use a maximum of 24 hours of paid time off for their personal reasons each year. The maximum allowance per year should be pro-rated for newly hired or rehired employees, and for part-time employees.\nPTO is available at the beginning of the calendar year. Employees may \"borrow\" up to their full amount of PTO before it is credited to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid during winter close. PTO may not be carried forward from year to year. If the employee is to be terminated and has unused PTO, arrange for the employee to take PTO before termination. Any remaining unused PTO is paid in the employee's final paycheck.\n(2) Reporting Personal Time Off\nNon-Exempt Employees: Record all PTO taken during a pay period in the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS).\nExempt Employees: PTO is generally not reported in increments of less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours.\n(3) Scheduling Personal Time Off\nAn employee is not obligated to explain how they intend to use personal time off. Specific arrangements are subject to supervisory approval and scheduling compatible with departmental operational needs.\n(4) Change in Status\nWhen an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their unused PTO. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding PTO, including policies regarding PTO use and limits on PTO allowance.\nf. PTO Augmenting Disability Payments\nUnless the employee applies to their department for an exception, which is approved, the university uses an employee's accrued time off (sick, PTO for the calendar year, floating holiday and vacation, in that order) to maintain the employee's base pay during times when the employee is receiving disability benefit payments. See Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves, section 6.\ng. Bereavement Leave\n(1) Regular Employee\nA regular employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave with regular pay upon the death of a close family member. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the death of the close family member. When additional time off is needed, a department may approve use of vacation or personal leave without pay.\n(2) Contingent Employee\nA contingent (i.e. casual or temporary) employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave without pay upon the death of a close family member. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the death of the close family member.\n(3) Definition of Close Family Member\nA Close Family Member is limited to the employee's spouse; same-sex domestic partner; children of the employee, spouse or same-sex domestic partner; parents and parents-in-law; brothers and sisters of the employee; and grandparents and grandchildren of the employee as these terms are defined by law. An employee may be asked to provide documentation of the death of the close family member. If you have questions about how a close family member is defined, please contact University Human Resources-Employee & Labor Relations.\n(4) Notification of Requested Leave\nThe employee should inform their supervisor of the need for bereavement leave as soon as practicable.\nh. Reproductive Loss Leave\n(1) Regular Employee\nA regular employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave following a reproductive loss event. Employees may use available vacation, sick leave, or personal leave without pay. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the reproductive loss event. \nIf an employee experiences more than one reproductive loss event within a 12-month period, the employee may take up to five days of leave following a subsequent reproductive loss event, but no more than 20 days within a 12-month period. \n(2) Contingent Employee\nA contingent (i.e. casual or temporary) employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave following a reproductive loss event. Employees may use available sick leave or personal leave without pay. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the reproductive loss event. \nIf an employee experiences more than one reproductive loss event within a 12-month period, the employee may take up to five days of leave following a subsequent reproductive loss event, but no more than 20 days within a 12-month period.\n(3) Definition of Reproductive Loss Event\nA reproductive loss event means the day or, for a multiple-day event, the final day of a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted reproduction.\n(4) Notification of Requested Leave\nThe employee should inform their supervisor of the need for reproductive loss leave as soon as practicable.\ni. Military Training Leave\nWhen required to perform annual military training duty a regular employee receives time off for the period of actual training, up to 17 calendar days a year. The university supplements the employee's military base pay for the scheduled working days of absence, up to the employee's full salary or wage. Employees must complete one year of employment in order to receive supplemental military training pay from the university. (Refer to section 4.f. for procedures.) See your Human Resources Manager for more information.\nj. Paid Organ Donor Leave\nUnder California law, eligible employees are entitled to a paid leave of absence up to 30 days for the purpose of organ donation and up to 5 days for bone marrow donation in any one-year period. Use of accrued time for a portion of the leave will be required to the extent permitted by law. For details, see Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability & Family Leave, section 4.\nk. Paid Leave during Natural Disasters and Emergencies\nWhen the Vice President for Human Resources, in coordination with university leadership, determines that a natural disaster, emergency, or certain other extraordinary circumstances prevent regular employees from performing work, paid time off will be provided to those impacted for the first three days of their regularly scheduled time that they are unable to work. \nIf the particular circumstances exceed three days, the Vice President for Human Resources, in coordination with university leadership, will determine whether and for how long Paid Leave During Natural Disasters and Emergencies will continue, any changes in eligibility requirements, or any changes in compensation or benefits provided. Employees who are not scheduled to work, are on another paid or unpaid leave of absence, or are able and assigned to perform work (for example if an employee can safely work from another location) are not eligible for Paid Leave during Natural Disasters and Emergencies. \nExamples of situations where this policy may apply include natural disasters or other emergencies such as earthquake, wildfire, or inclement weather which cause evacuation, stoppage of operations, or other inability to continue to perform work. There will be notification by the university if such a situation arises.\n2. Other Absences\nNOTE: These leaves of themselves are unpaid and do not result in the employee receiving pay from the university. Depending on the nature of the leave, however, an employee may be required to use other accrued time off, e.g., accrued vacation, personal time off, or sick time, during the leave or may be eligible to receive disability benefits pursuant to the terms of the university's Voluntary Disability Insurance plan.\na. Types of Leave of Absence Without Pay\n(1) Personal Leave\nA regular employee may be placed on personal leave without pay at a department's discretion. Extra time off in conjunction with paid vacation or time off to take care of family circumstances are examples of situations that may be the basis for granting personal leave.\n(2) Disability Leave\nSee Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time: Regular Staff Employees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians, and Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves, for information relating to leaves necessitated by the employee's own injury or illness or the illness of a family member.\n(3) Professional or Educational Leave\nA regular employee may be granted a leave of absence by a department to pursue activities or educational courses that will enhance the employee's value to the university. This type of leave should not exceed one year. Stanford Benefits must be notified prior to the leave start date for continuation of the university’s contributions toward health benefits plans and retirement savings plan. (Time for participation in training, education, or professional development required and assigned by the department is paid work time. Refer to Guide Memo 2.1.12: Staff Development Program, for policy regarding time off with pay to participate in staff training and development programs.)\n(4) Public Service Leave\nA department may grant a regular employee a leave of absence for temporary participation in community, state, or national affairs, including elective public office. However, long-term or continuing full-time employment by a public or community agency normally is not a suitable basis for approval of a leave of absence.\n(5) Military Service Leave\nA regular employee who voluntarily enters military service or is called for active duty for an extended period should contact their Human Resources Manager for more information. [For short-time periods of military training duty refer to \"military training leave\" under 1.f. above; for leave of absence right for spouses of military personnel refer to 2.a.(6)-Other Leaves, below.] Certain leaves for family of members of the armed forces are outlined in Guide Memo 2.1.18: Military Leave.\n(6) Other Leaves\nThe university provides leaves of absence as required by law, such as Volunteer Firefighters Leave, Parent's Leave for School Discipline, Parent's Leave for Children in School, Literacy Leave, time off from work for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, absence from work for victims of crime and certain persons related to victims for judicial proceedings, and leave of absence right for spouses of military personnel while such personnel are on a leave from deployment. Consult with Employee and Labor Relations for details about any of these leaves. \nb. Benefits Continuation During Unpaid Absences\n(1) Benefits Continuation\nThe employee's insurance and health care plans will continue during an unpaid leave of absence if the employee pays their portion of the cost of coverage. Exception: An employee on a personal leave of absence must pay the entire cost of coverage (employee and employer portion). The employee will be billed the appropriate amount for their benefits during the unpaid leave of absence.\n(2) Retirement Contributions\nAll retirement plan contributions stop while employees are on an unpaid leave of absence.\n(3) Benefits Cancellation\nAn employee on an unpaid leave may choose to cancel coverage during the leave period. If the coverage is not cancelled within 31 days of the start of the leave, the employee will be billed for coverage. To cancel coverage, the employee must take action; visit the Cardinal at Work website or contact the University HR Service Team. The employee can re-enroll in benefits as soon as they return to work in a benefits-eligible position.\n3. Policies for Leaves of Absence\na. Length of Leave\nEach leave of absence must be for a definite period with specific starting and ending dates. A leave cannot extend beyond the end of a fixed-term appointment. Whenever a proposed leave will result in a total period of absence exceeding 12 months, prior approval is required from local Human Resources Manager and the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee) or the Director of Human Resources at SLAC. Approval of leaves exceeding 12 months should be rare.\nb. Reinstatement Requirement\nA department granting or recommending a leave of absence is obligated to reinstate the employee in the same or a similar position at the end of the leave. Under special circumstances, the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee) may approve a recommended leave when the employee has waived in writing the reemployment obligation. A leave of absence is not appropriate when the employee cannot provide reasonable assurance of intention to return to University employment at the end of the leave.\nc. Termination of Leave by Layoff\nWhen a layoff situation occurs in a department while an employee is on a leave of absence, normal layoff procedures will apply and will include the employee on leave. If a leave is terminated by layoff, the standard provisions for severance pay, reemployment, and benefits continuation are applicable.\nd. Failure to Return from Leave\nWhen an employee does not return to work at the end of a leave, or when a department learns that an employee will not return, the department initiates a termination of the leave and of the individual's employee status, citing the reason for the employee's separation.\n4. Guide to Supervisors\na. Records\nPeopleSoft/Axess should reflect both paid and unpaid absences indicating the type of leave and the period of absence. Retain in the department files documentation such as evidence of disability and written request for leave.\nb. Advance Approval\nWhen a leave requires advance approval from the Vice President for Human Resources (or the Director of Human Resources at SLAC), the department's request for approval should include the department's written recommendation.\nc. Change in Circumstances During Leave Without Pay\nWhen any change in circumstances make it necessary to modify a leave of absence, discuss the situation with the Human Resources Manager before any action is taken.\nd. Benefit Plan Arrangements\nEmployees on an unpaid leave of absence will be billed by Vita Administration Companies for their insurance and health plan premiums on an after-tax basis. Employees must pay the premiums promptly to Vita.\ne. Work Schedule Modifications\nSupervisors should adhere to University policies and government requirements regarding overtime pay when modifying a nonexempt employee's work schedule to provide the employee with personal time off. (See Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees, for policies on work scheduling.)\nf. Procedures for Military Training Pay\nThe employee should be placed on Leave of Absence Unpaid for reason of Military Service so health and life benefits are not interrupted. When training leave ends, the employee must provide a copy of the pay stub verifying income received from the military. The department then adjusts the employee's pay for the leave period so that the adjusted salary plus military pay equals the usual full-time salary. (See Guide Memo 2.1.18: Military Leave.)\ng. Reemployment Rights of Veterans\nAny employee who enters military service may have legally guaranteed reemployment rights. When an employee goes into military service, the employee's department should obtain information about these rights from Human Resources."}

For policies that apply to staff employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the agreements between Stanford University and SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and Stanford University and the Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Association. Agreements can be found at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. Procedures for SLAC employees may vary. Contingent staff employees do not accrue vacation (see Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, Section 7.b.).\n1. Accrual of Vacation\na. \"Period of Service\" for the Purpose of Determining Vacation Accrual Rates\n\"Period of service\" for the purpose of determining vacation accrual rates means the years of service counted from the employee's initial hire date as a \"regular staff employee,\" as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. Months that count as service are:\nthose for which some pay is received, and\nthose following layoff when rehire occurs within 24 months.\nb. Accrual Rate Change Dates\nChanges in vacation rate accruals (both increases and decreases) are effective on the first day of the employee's anniversary or status change month. The accrual change is credited in the system by the last day of that month.\nc. Vacation Accrual Amounts\n(1) For Full-time Employment\nVacation leave accrues according to the following tables:\nVacation Leave Accruals, Non-exempt Staff\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt StaffPer Hour on Straight Time Pay StatusApproximate Days Accrued per Year\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt Staff During first year\tPer Hour on Straight Time Pay Status 0.057700\tApproximate Days Accrued per Year 15\t\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt Staff Beginning year 2 through end of year 9\tPer Hour on Straight Time Pay Status 0.07693\tApproximate Days Accrued per Year 20\t\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt Staff Beginning year 10 and thereafter\tPer Hour on Straight Time Pay Status 0.092310\tApproximate Days Accrued per Year 24\t\nVacation Leave Accruals, Exempt Staff\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked)Hours per Calendar MonthApproximate Days per Year\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked) During first year\tHours per Calendar Month 10\tApproximate Days per Year 15\t\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked) Beginning year 2 through end of year 9\tHours per Calendar Month 13.33\tApproximate Days per Year 20\t\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked) Beginning year 10 and thereafter\tHours per Calendar Month 16\tApproximate Days per Year 24\t\n(2) For Part-time and Part-month Employment\nVacation is credited on a prorated basis for all hours in straight time pay status (not overtime) in the month credited. \"Straight-time pay\" for the purpose of vacation accrual includes both straight-time pay for work performed and pay for holidays, vacation, and sick time. (For more information, see Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees.) Accrual for exempt employees is prorated based on the proportion of the employee's FTE.\nd. Method of Accruing Vacation\n(1) Vacation Does Accrue\nVacation accrues from the first month of employment during non-overtime periods of work, sick time, and vacation. During seasonal layoff, vacation accrues as if the employee were continuing to work regular time. Vacation is credited at the end of each month of service.\n(2) Vacation Does Not Accrue\nNo vacation accrues:\nDuring any period of terminal vacation, pursuant to section 2.g.(2).\nDuring periods of leave with or without pay, including periods of short-term disability, long-term disability, Workers' Compensation, or when using Family Temporary Disability wage replacement (FTD).\ne. Maximum Vacation Accumulation\n(1) Accrual Limits\nUnused vacation accumulates from year to year, but the maximum amount of vacation that a full time employee can accrue is 240 hours (30 work days). If an employee has accrued the maximum, vacation ceases to accrue. Vacation time will again accrue after the employee uses vacation time and the balance falls below 240 hours. The employee is not credited any vacation not earned due to having reached the 240 hour accrual maximum. New accruals will not exceed the 240 hour maximum.\n(2) Accrual Limits for Part-time Employment\nThe maximum allowable accrual is prorated based on the eligible employee's FTE.\n(3) Approval for Exceptions\nAny exception to the maximum allowable accrual must be requested in writing in advance by the employee's department, must identify the unique operational requirements that warrant the exception, and must be directed to the Vice President for Human Resources. Only the Vice President for Human Resources may grant an exception to the accrual maximum.\n(4) Change in Status\nWhen an employee's change in status from full-time to part-time results in an employee's vacation accumulation exceeding the employee's new maximum, the employee is paid for the excess at the time of the status change unless the employee and the employee's department mutually agree upon arrangements for the excess to be taken within a short period of time. Such arrangements can provide for a combination of payment and vacation. Payment is based on the pay rate that was in effect immediately before the status change.\n2. Use of Vacation\na. No Advance on Vacation\nEmployees may not use vacation before it has been credited, except for borrowing up to the amount the employee would normally accrue in one month to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid during Winter Closure.\nb. Scheduling of Vacations\nDepartments are responsible for providing opportunities for employees to take vacations each year. Vacation should normally be taken in the fiscal year when it is accrued. Specific arrangements are subject to supervisory approval and scheduling compatible with depart-mental operational needs, and should consider the employee's preferences. If an employee has not scheduled vacation, they may be required to use accrued vacation time before the close of the fiscal year in which it was accrued, or before the close of a grant or contract that supports the employee's salary.\nc. Reporting Vacation Time\nNon-Exempt Employees - Record all vacation time taken during a pay period in the human resources management system (HRMS).\nExempt Employees - Vacation time is generally not reported in increments of less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours.\nd. Use of Vacation for Non-vacation Absences\nVacation accruals can be used for other absences (e.g., disability, personal, Winter Closure) when requested by the employee and approved by the supervisor.\ne. Advance Pay for Vacations\nSee Guide Memo 2.2.3: University Payroll.\nf. Pay in Lieu of Vacation\nVacation accruals cannot be converted to cash except when employment terminates or when a change in employment status results in an employee's accumulation exceeding the maximum allowable (see 1.e.(1) above).\ng. Vacation Payment upon Termination\n(1) Lump Sum Payment\nAt the termination of their regular staff employment with Stanford University, employees receive a lump sum payment at their current rate of pay for their accrued vacation and any unused PTO time and Floating Holiday hours.\n(2) Terminal Vacation\nTerminal vacation is a benefit the university offers to employees who are retiring pursuant to Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement or being laid off, in which the affected employee may elect to use their accrued vacation, unused PTO, and Floating Holiday hours in the period immediately following the employee's last day of active work. The time is used at the work commitment level held at retirement or layoff (e.g., a full-time employee will use 8 hours per day) to remain on the payroll. Any remaining accruals that are less than a full day are paid out to the employee on the last full day of terminal vacation.\nEligibility: Only employees who are retiring or being permanently laid off may elect to use unused Vacation accruals, Floating Holiday time and PTO hours after the last day of actual work. Employees who are being permanently laid off and are given pay in lieu of notice are not eligible for terminal vacation and will be paid their accrued and unused Vacation, Floating Holiday and PTO hours on their last day of employment. Employees who are involuntarily terminated but who may qualify to retire under Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement are also not eligible for terminal vacation.\nNotice: A laid off employee must submit to the local Human Resources office written notice of their election to use accumulated hours in the form of terminal vacation within seven (7) calendar days of receiving notice of layoff. A retiring employee must submit to the local Human Resources office written notice of their election to use accumulated hours in the form of terminal vacation at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the last day of active work.\nAdditional Employment: While an employee is receiving terminal vacation pay, they cannot be employed in any other Stanford University position.\nEffect of Terminal Vacation: If the laid off employee elects to take terminal vacation, the new layoff effective date or retirement effective date will be the last day of the terminal vacation period. The severance repayment period and the laid off employee’s bridge period begins on the following business day. \nh. Leaves of Absence\nAn approved leave of absence without pay is not a termination of employment and lump-sum payment of accumulated vacation is not provided when an employee takes leave without pay.\ni. Changing Positions\nWhen an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their accumulated vacation accruals. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding vacation time, including policies regarding vacation time use and limits on vacation time accruals.\nj.

For policies that apply to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the applicable agreements between Stanford University and SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007, and Stanford University and the Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Association. Agreements can be found at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. \n1. Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of the University that employees are expected to carry out their assigned tasks and responsibilities as instructed and to conduct themselves in accordance with reasonable rules and expectations for the work place.\nUniversity policy is that employees cannot be terminated without some form of cause. \"Cause\" is defined broadly as any legitimate business reason, including but not limited to:\nFailure to satisfactorily perform job duties or meet job requirements\nUnavailability for work\nExcessive absences or tardiness\nDisclosure or misuse of confidential information\nDamage or misuse of University property\nInsubordination\nFailure to follow University policies and procedures\nFailure to return from an approved leave\nFailure or refusal to fully cooperate with a university investigation and/or request for information\nUnsatisfactory conduct or\nAny other conduct or acts detrimental to or that disrupt the reputation or operations of the University\nCorrective action is taken when an employee has not conformed to performance or conduct expectations. University policy does not require corrective action be taken in any formal steps or order, and recognizes that the determination of appropriate corrective action will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. Moreover, some forms of conduct, including any form of gross misconduct, warrant immediate termination.\nRefer to Guide Memo 2.1.11: Staff Grievance Policy for information regarding corrective actions that can be grieved.\n2. Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to make clear to supervisors and employees when corrective action or termination can be imposed.\n3. Guide to Supervisors\na. Overview\nIt is the responsibility of the supervisor to provide honest and constructive performance feedback to their direct reports.\nb. Notice\nSupervisors are normally required to give written notice (e.g., email, memo, performance evaluation, letter, etc.) that performance or behavior is unsatisfactory and improvement is needed before terminating an employee. Such notice may or may not be preceded by verbal coaching/counseling. However, prior notice is not necessary in cases where immediate termination is appropriate (please consult with local Human Resources office).\nc. Termination\nAs mentioned in section 3.b, supervisors are normally required to provide notice to an employee of performance deficiencies before termination. However, there is no requirement that notice be provided before termination of employment in all cases. A supervisor must consult with the applicable manager(s) within their school/unit and their local Human Resources office regarding a possible termination. Termination must be reviewed and approved in advance by University Human Resources-Employee & Labor Relations."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/staff-grievance-policy","text":"2.1.11 Staff Grievance Policy | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nNovember 15, 2022 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.10\nThis Guide Memo outlines the policy to resolve staff employee complaints at Stanford through a formal grievance process and is designed specifically for regular employees as defined in the \"Applicability\" section. The Staff Grievance Process is intended to supplement, not replace, routine and informal methods of responding to and resolving employee complaints.\nThe Staff Grievance Process is located in the Grievance/Appeal Processes section of the Cardinal at Work website.\nEmployee complaints covered by the Staff Grievance Process include written corrective actions that are placed in an employee’s personnel file (e.g., written warnings) and involuntary terminations (including layoffs) only. The Staff Grievance Process does not apply to employee complaints regarding other issues such as performance appraisals, Performance Improvement Plans, compensation/benefits or job classifications. Information regarding resources to address workplace concerns can be found in the Address Concerns section of the Cardinal at Work website.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all regular employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions.\nIt does not apply to:\nTrial period employees (see Guide Memo 2.1.15, Trial Period)\nCasual or temporary employees\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining agreements, found at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. \nAcademic Staff – Research (see Research Policy Handbook)\nAcademic Staff – Teaching (see Research Policy Handbook)\nAcademic Staff – Libraries (see Policy Manual for Academic Staff-Libraries)\nSenior staff (see Guide Memo 2.1.14)\nFaculty (see Faculty Handbook)\nIf a trial period, casual, or temporary employee who is involuntarily terminated has concerns and/or feedback regarding their employment, they may contact the local Human Resources Office or University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations.\n1. Informal Resolution\nRegular and effective communication between supervisors and employees reduces the likelihood of misunderstanding and conflict. Stanford University expects and encourages supervisors and employees to communicate openly and regularly so that the interests of the employee and the university are best served. To support this commitment, the university has this Staff Grievance Process and resource offices such as the local Human Resources Office, University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations, the Faculty Staff Help Center and the Office of the Ombuds to assist employees in resolving employee complaints.\nBefore initiating Step 1 of the Staff Grievance Process, the employee is strongly encouraged to make at least one informal attempt to resolve their concerns. If the employee feels uncomfortable in attempting to do this by him/herself, assistance is available through the local Human Resources Office, University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations, the Faculty Staff Help Center, or the Office of the Ombuds.\n2. Formal Staff Grievance Process\nIf the employee is unsuccessful in resolving their complaint informally, they may file a formal grievance with University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations. The Staff Grievance Process and other information is located in the Grievance/Appeal Processes section of the Cardinal at Work website.\n3. Representation and Support\na. Self-Representation\nThe employee will act as their own representative at each step in the Staff Grievance Process.\nb. Support Person\nIn the case of a grievance that is heard by a Grievance Advisory Board, the employee may choose to have a support person accompany them to the grievance hearing. The employee may select any one university employee who:\nis not employed as an attorney\nis both willing and able to attend the hearing without impairing their own work duties, and\nreceives their supervisor's approval\nc. Outside Representation\nThe Staff Grievance Process does not allow for outside representation of any kind at any step of the process. If at any time before or during the Staff Grievance Process the employee chooses to elect action related to the grievance issue(s) outside of the internal process (such as filing a charge with the EEOC, California Civil Rights Department, other administrative body, or a lawsuit), the Staff Grievance Process will be terminated without any decision being reached.\n4. Time Frames\nAll times frames indicated in the Staff Grievance Process are computed in calendar days unless noted otherwise. All parties involved in the Staff Grievance Process must adhere to the time frames specified. Exceptions to this rule will be handled on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by the Vice President of Human Resources (or designee). The period of the Winter Close is excluded from the time frames.\n5. Administration\nUniversity Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations have primary responsibility for administering and coordinating the Staff Grievance Process. In addition, University Human Resources/Employee & Labor Relations is the primary source of assistance for employees and supervisors who have questions or concerns pertaining to the Staff Grievance Process.\n6. Protection Against Retaliation\nNo adverse action may be taken against any employee because of their good faith participation in the Staff Grievance Process. An adverse action is any action that materially affects that individual’s terms and conditions of employment."}

Policy on Repayment of Severance Pay\nThe months following the termination date comprise the \"severance repayment period.\" This period is equal to the number of months of severance pay received. If a Senior Staff employee is reemployed by the university before the end of the severance repayment period, that portion of the severance pay equal to the base pay they would have earned if not terminated may be retained by the employee. The balance of the severance pay is to be repaid in full at the time of reemployment, unless the employee authorizes and the university approves a reasonable schedule of repayment and payroll deduction, not to exceed one year in length, in writing on a form provided by University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations.\nf. Policy on Outplacement Services\nSenior Staff whose employment terminates due to permanent layoff will be eligible for three months of outplacement services to be used within six months of the date the employee receives written notification of their layoff. The outplacement services shall be provided by an outplacement agency designated by the university, in its sole discretion, and the cost for such services shall be borne by the university in an amount to be determined from time to time, with additional amounts, if any, to be paid by the department from which the employee was laid off and approved by the Vice President of Human Resources (or designee).\n5.

Staff Tuition Reimbursement Program (STRP)\nEligible employees may request STRP support for courses that fulfill undergraduate or graduate degree requirements at a fully accredited college, university, technical/vocational school or institute, special skills school, or adult education school when the employee is admitted to the degree program (certificate programs excluded). Courses must be taken at, or online through, a regionally-accredited institution recognized by the U.S. Department of Education in order to be eligible for reimbursement. The employee's supervisor must approve the request if release time/time off (with or without pay) is requested.\nCovered degree programs:\nAssociate\nBachelor\nMaster\nDoctoral\nPrograms that are not covered:\nIndividual courses\nCertifications\nGraduate Certificate\nDegree program entrance exams, such as SAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, GMAT, MCAT\nChallenge exams or credit by exam, such as CLEP, UEXCEL and DSST\na. Release Time/Time Off without Pay\nAn eligible staff employee may be granted a maximum of 24 hours per month of release time, without pay, for an approved undergraduate or graduate course, if no comparable course is offered during non-work hours. Time off for part-time regular staff should be pro-rated based on the percent time worked. Approval of time off is at the department's discretion and must be compatible with the work schedule of the department and consistent with requirements of contracts and grants regarding time worked.\nb. Tuition Payment\nPayment of tuition and covered fees through STRP will be made directly to the institution before attendance each quarter or semester.\n4. Allowable Expenses\nAn employee may not receive reimbursement under STAP and reimbursement under STRP for the same course or program. For example, you cannot use STRP for tuition and STAP for books, supplies and equipment for the same course or program.\na. STAP Expenses\nThe current maximum STAP reimbursement is: \n$800 for eligible employees not covered by the SEIU Collective Bargaining Agreement\n$700 for eligible employees covered by the SEIU Collective Bargaining Agreement \n$100 of STAP funds for SEIU-represented staff are reallocated for a leadership, training and educational program, known as the Apprenticeship Program. (For additional information, refer to the 2014 Collective Bargaining Agreement between SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, Side Letter 7: Leadership, Training and Educational Fund).\nCosts of tuition, registration fees, and required textbooks, CDs, e-books, or tapes are allowable for reimbursement up to a maximum determined each fiscal year.\nTravel expenses, parking, lodging, meals, professional memberships, testing and exam fees, reference books, and professional subscriptions are not allowable.\nb. STRP Expenses\nThe current maximum annual STRP benefit amount is $5,250 granted to the eligible employee at the beginning of each fiscal year. Payments and reimbursements are pro-rated for part-time eligible staff working at least 50% time.\nCovered fees are limited to the cost of tuition, registration fee, lab fees, course fees, and eLearning fees.\nCovered expenses are limited to required books, CDs, DVDs, and other published materials, supplies, and equipment, including software. Supplies, equipment, and software that the employee may keep after the course is completed are not a covered expense.\nAn employee may not use STAP and STRP funds for the same course or program.\n5. Reimbursement\na. Timing of STAP Reimbursement\nRequests for reimbursement of allowable expenses through STAP must be made within 60 days of satisfactory completion of the training, with the approval of the supervisor. Submitted requests will be charged against the STAP funds based on the class start date. Refer to the STAP Frequently Asked Questions for details on the reimbursement process.\nb. Timing of STRP Payment\nPayment of tuition and covered fees will be made directly to the institution by the program administrator before attendance each quarter or semester. If the employee makes payment directly to the institution, the employee must submit the invoice to the program administrator through a Direct Bill request. The program administrator will make payment directly to the institution, and the institution will issue a credit or reimbursement to the employee.\nc. Departmental Reimbursement\nWhen covered costs exceed the current STAP/STRP limit, the excess cost may be partially or fully reimbursed by the employee's department. Departmental reimbursement is at the department's discretion and is determined based on available departmental funds for training. Reimbursement for work-related or career development training may be taxable if the total exceeds $5,250 in one tax year (see Section 7a), regardless of the source of university funds. Departmental reimbursements have the same tax consequences as STAP/STRP reimbursements.\nd. Employee Obligation\nWhen the university reimburses an employee for training costs through STAP prior to completion of the activity, the employee assumes an obligation to complete the supported training in a satisfactory manner. An employee who does not complete university-reimbursed training must repay the university the total amount of the reimbursement.\ne. Evidence of Satisfactory Completion\nEmployees utilizing funds for training expenses through STAP must provide the supervisor with evidence of satisfactory completion as soon as possible—but no later than 60 days after the training activity is completed. For STRP, evidence of satisfactory completion must be provided to both the supervisor (if supervisor approval was required) and to EdAssist, the STRP administration vendor, within 60 days of the course end date. Such evidence may be an official grade card or transcript from the institution or provider of the course. Failure to submit evidence of course completion within 60 days will require the employee to repay the tuition/fee/expense amount to Stanford and could result in the denial of all future requests for tuition assistance. Refer to the STRP Guidelines for details on the Evidence of Satisfactory Completion submission process.\nFor undergraduate academic courses using STRP funds, a grade C or better, or pass grade in a pass/fail course is required. A grade of C- or less will not be accepted as a satisfactory grade.\nFor graduate academic courses, using STRP funds, a grade B or better, or pass in a pass/fail course is required. A grade of B- will not be accepted as a satisfactory grade.\nIf a course may be taken for either a letter grade or a pass/fail grade, the employee must take the course for a letter grade to be eligible for STRP funds for this course.\nf. Repayments\nStaff members who have utilized STRP are required to repay tuition and fees that were paid to STRP to an institution for coursework if: \nEmployee withdraws from a course after the tuition was paid\nEmployee fails to submit proof of satisfactory completion\nFor undergraduate course work, the employee receives a grade of C- or lower or Fail (if a Pass/Fail course)\nFor graduate course work, the employee receives a grade B- or lower or Fail (if a Pass/Fail course)\n6. Application Process\na. STAP\nAn employee planning a training or development activity should discuss development and performance objectives with their supervisor before registering for the course or program. Decisions regarding the applicability of training and issues regarding release time should be made at this time. The employee and the supervisor should review career development plans before registration. No application form is needed.\nDepartmental Review\nThe supervisor should review the staff training assistance request and evidence of satisfactory completion, confirming the following:\nEmployee eligibility (see Section 1)\nProgram applicability (see Section 2 and 3)\nCovered fees and expenses (see Section 4)\nCourse completion (see Section 5)\nHealthy Living offerings or Stanford Continuing Studies Program (CSP) courses are not subject to supervisor approval unless release time is required.\nb. STRP\nThe employee must submit an application for each term (quarter or semester) no earlier than 90 days prior to the start of classes and no later than 30 days after the start of classes. If a supervisor's signature is required for release time/time off with pay, the employee must complete the Supervisor Approval Form. The Supervisor Approval Form can be found and printed from the Stanford My Learning Center website and must be sent to the Stanford STRP office with the employee and supervisor's signature within five business days of application submission. Failure to submit the Supervisor Approval Form will result in a denial of the application.\nPayment of Tuition and Covered Fees\nThe Direct Bill option should be used to request payment of tuition and fees directly to the employee's school by following the four-step application process in My Learning Center, located on the STRP website.\nExpense Reimbursement\nThe Expense Reimbursement option should be used if the employee has paid for tuition and/or allowable fees and or expenses. The employee must make the request and submit documentation as proof of payment within 60 days of the course end date. Detailed information about the application, payment, and reimbursement process can be found on the STRP website.\nc. Tuition & Training Programs Review\nThe Tuition & Training Programs office monitors and periodically audits applications for conformance with standards of eligibility, applicability, and allowability as outlined in this Guide Memo. The Tuition & Training Programs office has final approval over any disputes, of application denial or denial of payment and reimbursements for approved applications. A decision by the Tuition & Training Programs office concerning approval or disapproval of applications, payments, or reimbursements is not subject to review under any grievance procedure. Appeal of a decision by the Tuition & Training Programs office may be made in writing to the Director of Tuition & Training Programs in University Human Resources.\n7. Termination of Employment\na. New Applications\nNo applications will be accepted after employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ends.\nb. Expense Reimbursement\nIf employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ends before a request for reimbursement of covered expenses has been submitted, an employee may submit a manual request for reimbursement if the reason for termination is for any of the following reasons:\nLayoff\nLayoff to Retirement\nRetirement\nMilitary Service\nTransfer from the University to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\nTransfer from SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to the university\nIf employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ended for any other reason, an employee will not be eligible to request or receive reimbursement for expenses after the date employment ended. However, if an application was submitted and approved, and tuition and fees were paid directly to the employee’s school prior to the date employment ended for any reason, their will not be required to repay that amount.\n8. Tax Implications\nSDP is intended to provide benefits that are, to the extent possible, excluded from taxation under federal and state laws. Accordingly, this Guide Memo constitutes a separate written plan for the exclusive benefit of employees under sections 127 and 132(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations, to provide such employees with educational assistance.\na. General Rule\nIn general, an employee may exclude up to $5,250 received for graduate or undergraduate education under STRP and up to $800 received under STAP from their gross income each tax year for allowable tuition and covered fees and expenses.\nb. Tax Year\nEmployees should note that STRP provides reimbursements of up to $5,250 for each Stanford fiscal year. Because Stanford's fiscal year runs from September 1 through August 31, an employee could be eligible to receive reimbursements in excess of $5,250 for the employee's tax year.\nc. Other Situations\nAmounts paid to an employee in excess of $5,250 may also be excluded if they are payments for certain job-related training, when such training maintains or improves the skills of an employee. However, if the training is necessary for the employee to meet the minimum educational requirements for employment, or if the training will qualify the employee for a new trade or business, the payments will not qualify for this additional exclusion.\nd. Getting Help\nEmployees should consult their personal tax advisor with any questions.\n9. Status and Duration of Staff Development Program\na. Administration\nSDP is administered by the university. The university has the discretionary authority to determine all matters with respect to SDP, including, without limitation, eligibility issues, benefit amounts, evidentiary matters, and tax treatment. Its decisions shall be final and binding on all persons.\nb. Amendment and Termination\nThe university reserves the right to modify SDP in any respect, or to discontinue SDP, at any time."}

Social Security Retirement Benefits \nThe Social Security program provides retirement benefits to individuals who have worked long enough in covered employment to become fully insured. Reduced benefits are payable to retirees starting at age 62 and before Social Security normal retirement age based on year of birth. Increased benefits result from deferring retirement beyond normal retirement age. After the start of benefits, amounts earned from gainful employment in excess of limits set by law may reduce Social Security payments. Employees and employers pay the costs of the Social Security program. Local offices of the Social Security Administration will provide additional information and assistance with applications for benefits.\n2. Official University Retirees\na.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/military-leave","text":"2.1.18 Military Leave | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nFebruary 09, 2022 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.17\nThe Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (\"USERRA\") prohibits employers from discriminating against employees who fulfill non-career military obligations in the Uniformed Services. It also requires employers to provide a leave of absence to allow employees to perform military obligations. Separately, the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") and California Family Rights Act (\"CFRA\") entitles eligible employees to take leave for a \"qualifying exigency\" when a covered family member is called to active duty and FLMA entitles eligible employees to take leave to care for a covered family member who is injured in the line of duty.\nThis policy provides military leaves as required by these and other laws and complies with the other relevant provisions of USERRA, other related regulations or as approved by Stanford University.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all regular staff as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, Academic Staff-Research, and Academic Staff-Libraries. For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. \n1. Military Training Leave\nWhen required to perform annual military training duty, a regular employee receives time off for the period of actual training, up to 17 calendar days a year. The University supplements the employee's military base pay for the scheduled working days of absence, up to the employee's full salary. Employees must complete one year of employment to receive supplemental military training pay from the University. Contact your local Human Resources Office for more information if needed.\nProcedures for Military Training Pay - The affected employee should be placed on Leave of Absence Unpaid for reason of Military Service so health and life benefits are not interrupted. Upon conclusion of the training leave, the employee must provide a copy of the pay stub verifying income received from the military. The department then adjusts the employee's pay for the leave period so that the adjusted salary plus military pay equal the usual full salary.\n2. Military Active Service Leave\nAn employee who voluntarily enters military service or is called to active duty for an extended period will have reinstatement rights to their current position if these requirements are met:\nThe employee ensures Stanford receives advance written or verbal notice of military service,\nThe period of service does not exceed five years,\nThe employee returns to work or applies for reemployment in a timely manner after service ends, and\nThe employee separates from military service under honorable conditions.\nContact your local Human Resources office with any questions about this information.\n3. Military Spousal Leave\na. Type of Leave\nUnder California law, up to 10 days of unpaid leave is available to eligible employees who are spouses/domestic partners of deployed members of the military when the military spouse/domestic partner is on leave from deployment during a time of military conflict.\nb. Eligibility\nTo be eligible for this form of leave, an employee must work an average of 20 or more hours per week and be the spouse or domestic partner of a \"qualified member\" of the United States Armed Forces, National Guard, or Reserves. A \"qualified member\" is a member of the United States Armed Forces who has been deployed during a period of military conflict. The employee also must provide: \nnotice of intention to take family military leave within two business days of receiving official notice that the employee's military spouse will be on leave from deployment, and\ndocumentation certifying the employee's military spouse will be on leave from deployment during the time that the employee requests leave.\n4. Qualifying Exigency (Emergency) Leave for Families for Members of the Armed Forces (FMLA/CFRA)\na. Type of Leave\nQualifying emergency leave allows eligible employees (see 4.b) to use some or all of their 12-week FMLA/CFRA leave entitlement for an emergency due to a family member's active duty or call to active duty in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Armed Forces include National Guard and Reserves. Qualifying emergencies are defined by regulation and include issues arising from a short-notice deployment, military events, child care, school activities, financial or legal arrangements, counseling, rest and recuperation, post-deployment activities, or any issue the University and employee agree to designate as a qualifying emergency.\nb. Eligibility\nEmployee must be a spouse, domestic partner, child or parent (includes “parent-in-law” under CFRA) of the service member.\nEmployees are eligible to take this type of leave if employed by the University at least one year and have worked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off, paid leave and unpaid leave not included) during the 12 months before the start of the requested leave.\n5. Military Caregiver Leave for Families for Members of the Armed Forces (FMLA)\na. Type of Leave\nMilitary caregiver leave allows eligible employees (see 4.b) up to 26 weeks of job-protected FMLA leave in a rolling 12-month period that begins on the verified FMLA start date to care for a covered family member who is a member of the Armed Forces and who:\nsuffers serious injury or illness in the line of duty, or\nundergoes medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness.\nService member means veterans and current members of the U.S. Armed Forces including the National Guard or Reserves.\nEligible employees may request caregiver leave to care for a veteran who:\nis undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a qualifying serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty, while on active duty. (A serious illness or injury can include a preexisting injury or illness that was aggravated in the line of duty, while on active duty.), and\nwas a member of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard or Reserves) at some point during the five-year period before undergoing the treatment, recuperation, or therapy.\nb. Eligibility\nEmployee must be a spouse, parent, son, daughter, or next of kin of the service member.\nEmployees are eligible to take this type of leave if employed by the University at least one year and have worked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off, paid leave and unpaid leave not included) during the 12 months before the start of the requested leave.\nNOTE: This leave entitlement does not increase the amount of time an employee can be off work for FMLA/CFRA reasons, except that up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave is available to care for an injured service member during a 12-month period.\nFor example, if an employee has used 12 weeks of FMLA/CFRA leave for the birth of a child, the employee is not entitled to an additional 12 weeks of leave within that 12-month period to deal with exigent circumstances arising from a family member's call to active duty. But, the employee would be entitled to up to another 12 weeks (for a total of 26 weeks combined) to care for a covered family member who is injured in the line of duty.\n6. Benefits during Military Leave\na. Health and Life Benefits\nEmployees on unpaid leave for Military Service (MIL) will have the same University benefit contributions as when actively employed.

Retiree Medical Eligibility\nTime on Leave for Military Services counts toward official retiree medical eligibility.\nd. Benefits in Cases of Termination\nMedical and Dental Coverage\nA regular employee whose University employment is terminated while the employee is on Military Leave may continue medical and dental coverages at their own expense through COBRA for 18 months.\nLife Insurance\nLife insurance portability or conversion to an individual plan is available. The individual should contact Stanford Benefits at the time of termination for the appropriate forms."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/layoffs","text":"2.1.17 Layoffs | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.16\nThis Guide Memo outlines Stanford University's policies and procedures for carrying out the temporary, seasonal or permanent layoff of employees.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all regular staff employees and academic staff as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, except for Academic Staff-Teaching, who should refer to the Faculty Handbook, and Senior Staff, who should refer to Guide Memo 2.1.14: Senior Staff. For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. Trial period and contingent (temporary and casual) employees are not eligible for layoff benefits.\n1. Policy Statement\nLayoffs may be temporary or permanent, and may occur because of budgetary reasons, lack of work, reorganization, or redefinition of the university’s or the department’s needs. The university shall determine when layoffs will occur, the administrative unit, department, or work group in which the layoff will occur (i.e., the layoff unit), and which position(s) are subject to layoff. Such decisions are not subject to review. The layoff process and implementation must be carried out in coordination with the local human resources manager with the approval of University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations.\n2. Definitions\na. A temporary or seasonal layoff\nis the removal of a regular staff employee from work for a period not exceeding six months. A temporary or seasonal layoff occurs when, in the judgment of the university, a temporary reduction in the workforce or of a particular kind of work is necessary within a particular layoff unit. There is no break in continuity of university service during temporary or seasonal layoff.\nb. A permanent layoff\nis the separation from university employment of a regular staff employee who has completed the trial period due to:\nthe elimination of a position, or\nthe reduction of a position to less than 75% time, or\nthe reduction of a position from regular to non-regular status.\n3. Layoff Notice\na. Temporary or Seasonal Layoff\nEmployees designated for temporary or seasonal layoff should be given at least two weeks’ (14 calendar days’) notice in advance of the layoff date, except in cases of emergency or in circumstances beyond the university’s control. If notice is provided orally, it should be followed with confirming written notice by no later than the actual date of layoff.\nThe written notice must include the effective date of layoff and the date the employee is instructed to return to work. Any change to the terms in the layoff notice should also be confirmed in writing.\nb. Permanent Layoff\nNotice or Pay in Lieu of Notice: In cases of permanent layoff, the department must give one month's (e.g., June 15 through July 15) written notice. In limited circumstances and with approval from University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations, departments may give up to three months' written notice. In limited circumstances and with approval from University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations, departments may give pay in lieu of notice. When pay is given in lieu of notice, one month is the maximum period for which such payment can be made.\nc. Early Resignation\nIf an employee resigns after receiving written notification of permanent layoff and prior to the effective date of layoff, the balance of the notice period will not be converted to pay. However, the employee remains eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with the terms of this policy and the schedule below (see section 6). Severance pay will be recalculated to reflect the last day of employment.\nd. Layoff of Academic Staff-Research and Academic Staff-Libraries\nWhen layoffs of Academic Staff-Research or Academic Staff-Libraries occur for programmatic reasons, the employee must be given three months’ written notice. When pay is given in lieu of notice, three months is the maximum period for which such payment can be made.\nWhen layoffs of Academic Staff-Research or Academic Staff-Libraries occur for non-programmatic reasons, such as lack of available financial support, the employee must be given at least one month’s written notice, but no more than three months' written notice, or when pay is given in lieu of notice, a maximum of one month's pay.\ne. Change in Layoff Status\nNotice of layoff to a regular staff employee may be changed in the following circumstances:\nDeferral of Layoff: A regular staff employee who is notified of layoff but has not yet been laid off and who subsequently accepts work that is anticipated to last less than six months will have their layoff date deferred to the end of the temporary assignment. Work can be within the same department or a different department. Layoff deferrals must be approved by University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations. A letter deferring the layoff must be issued to the employee with the new layoff date. Each layoff can be deferred one time only. If the employee resigns after notification of the deferral, they can receive severance pay, which will be recalculated to reflect the last day of employment. Severance pay is based on the employee’s rate of pay and percentage of full time in the position from which they were laid off.\nRescission of Layoff: A regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has not yet been laid off and subsequently is retained by the department either in the same, or a substantially equivalent, regular, benefits-eligible position, will have their layoff rescinded. Under these circumstances, the department shall give written notice to the employee that their layoff has been rescinded, after which the employee is no longer in \"layoff status,\" and will not receive severance pay if they resign. An employee who resigns after receiving a letter of layoff rescission will be considered a \"voluntary resignation,\" unless the employee has received a new notice of layoff. For any future staff reductions, the department should follow the normal notice and layoff procedures of this Guide Memo.\nRehire in a Different Department: A regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has not yet been laid off and subsequently is hired by any Stanford University department in a regular, benefits-eligible position will not receive severance pay. The position selected for layoff will still be eliminated or reduced. The employee will serve a layoff trial period as described in Guide Memo 2.1.15: Trial Period.\n4. Benefits and Time Off\na. Medical Plan Coverage\nStanford will continue its contribution to a laid off employee's medical plan for the employee and their enrolled dependents during the first three months after layoff, provided the employee signs the General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement and (1) timely elects COBRA and completes the necessary medical coverage selection and (2) timely pays any contributions required of the employee. The laid off employee is required to pay the full cost of the plan coverage, plus the administrative fee for coverage after the first three months of COBRA coverage. For temporary or seasonal layoffs, the university will make contributions to the employee’s medical plan and life insurance plan, subject to prompt payment of any required contributions by the employee during the layoff period (up to six months).\nb. Dental and Vision Coverage\nThe laid off employee pays the full cost of COBRA coverage, plus administrative fees, for dental and vision, beginning with the first day of COBRA eligibility. The university makes no contribution.\nc. Vacation and Sick Leave:\nA regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff may accrue vacation and sick leave in any month in which the employee receives pay, unless the employee is on terminal vacation. During temporary or seasonal layoff, vacation and sick leave accrue as if the employee were continuing to work regular time (please see Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations and Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time: Regular Staff Employees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians). The employee may use accumulated vacation, PTO, and floating holiday during temporary or seasonal layoff.\nd. Floating Holiday/Personal Time Off\nA regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff but has not yet been laid off will have floating holiday hours and personal time off made available on January 1 in accordance with Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays and Guide Memo 2.1.8: Miscellaneous Authorized Absences, unless the employee is on terminal vacation.\ne. Holiday Pay/Time Off:\nA regular staff employee who has received notice of layoff may receive holiday pay for any month in which the employee receives pay, and in which the employee is on paid status on the day preceding and the day following the university designated holiday, unless the employee is on terminal vacation. When the employee is on a temporary or seasonal layoff period not exceeding 25 calendar days, regular holiday pay for the employee's normally scheduled number of hours will be paid upon the employee's return to work; see Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays.\nf. Outplacement Services\nRegular staff employees whose employment terminates due to permanent layoff will be eligible for three months of outplacement services to commence within six months of the date the employee receives written notification of their layoff. The outplacement services shall be provided by an outplacement agency designated by the university, in its sole discretion, and the cost for such services shall be borne by the university in an amount to be determined from time to time, with additional amounts, if any, to be paid by the department from which the employee was laid off and approved by the Vice President for Human Resources (or designee).\ng. Employees Who Are Concurrently Notified of Layoff from the University and Offered a Position at Stanford Health Care or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital\nA regular staff employee who concurrently receives notification from the university of a permanent layoff and an offer of employment with Stanford Health Care or Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, and who accepts such offer of employment is not eligible for the severance pay, COBRA contributions or other layoff benefits described in Sections 4 and 6.\n5. Selection for Layoff\nTemporary or Seasonal Layoff: Management of the administrative unit, work group, or department decides which employees will be placed on temporary or seasonal layoff. The Dean of Research will review all cases involving senior research associates or research associates.\nPermanent Layoff\nPrior to providing notice of layoff to a regular staff employee within the layoff unit, the university should consider terminating temporary and trial period employees, provided the employees remaining in the layoff unit possess sufficient skills and abilities to do the work required. The elimination or reduction of a position as determined above will not result in a notice of layoff if: \nThe position is occupied by an employee still in the trial period, in which case the employee undergoes termination during the trial period (see Guide Memo 2.1.15: Trial Period), or\nThe position is occupied by a fixed-term employee whose fixed-term of employment concludes at the same time as the position is eliminated or reduced, or\nThe position is occupied by a contingent employee, in which case the contingent employee will be terminated, or\nThe position is occupied by an employee who accepts alternate university employment prior to the effective date of the layoff.\nExcept in the above four cases, the elimination or reduction of a position may result in a notice of layoff.\nManagement will determine the selection of employees for layoff or retention based on its judgment of the current and prospective operational and performance requirements in the layoff unit, and whether the affected employee's demonstrated performance, knowledge, skills, and abilities meet those requirements.\nWhen management deems that the performance, knowledge, skills, and abilities of employees necessary to meet the current and prospective operational and performance requirements are substantially equal, then length of continuous employment with the university and the university's affirmative action commitments will be considered in selecting employees for layoff, reassignment, or retention.\nFailure to Return to Work: If an employee on temporary or seasonal layoff fails to return to work when scheduled to return to work or when recalled to work, the employee shall be deemed to have resigned unless an additional leave of absence is requested and approved in advance of the return date. Written notice of termination must be given to the employee no later than the termination date and must include the date of termination and notice of the employee's right to apply for unemployment compensation benefits.\nReemployment from Layoff Status: An employee who has received notice of permanent layoff and who applies for other employment within the university will have an employment preference for hiring purposes (see Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting & Hiring of Regular Staff). \n6. Severance Pay\nEach eligible regular staff employee with one year or more of continuous university employment is eligible to receive severance pay on the date of permanent layoff in accordance with the Severance Pay Table below, provided a signed General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement is executed and the Agreement’s revocation period, if any, has expired. Severance payment generally is made on the last day of employment or within five working days after expiration of any revocation period in the General Release of All Claims and Severance Repayment Agreement, whichever is later.\nAn employee will not receive severance pay more than once for the same period of service with the university. To calculate future severance pay eligibility for an employee who was previously laid off: \nDetermine the severance pay eligibility (in months of base pay) from the table below.\nSubtract the eligibility corresponding to the number of months of severance pay previously received.\nAdd back in any months or partial months of severance pay previously repaid to the university (see Section 6(c)).\nFor purposes of any future severance calculation for a subsequent layoff, an employee who has received severance pay under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement and who is reemployed by the university in a position that is not covered by that collective bargaining agreement shall be considered a new employee. As such, their length of continuous service with the university will be calculated only from the date of reemployment unless the severance allowance is repaid in accordance with Section 6(c).\nSeverance Pay Table \nYears of continuous regular University employment1 severance pay eligibility in months of base pay2 \n1 year but less than 2\t0.5\t\n2 years but less than 4\t1\t\n4 years but less than 7\t2\t\n7 years but less than 10\t3\t\n10 years but less than 12\t4\t\n12 years but less than 14\t5\t\n14 years but less than 16\t6\t\n16 years but less than 18\t7\t\n18 years but less than 20\t8\t\n20 years but less than 22\t9\t\n22 years but less than 24\t10\t\n24 years but less than 26\t11\t\n26 years or more\t12\t\nRepayment of Severance Pay: The months following the layoff effective date comprise the \"severance repayment period.\" This period is equal to the number of months of severance pay received. If an employee is reemployed by the university as a regular benefits-eligible employee before the end of the severance repayment period, that portion of the severance pay equal to the base pay they would have earned if not terminated may be retained by the employee. Severance repayment will be prorated for an employee rehired into a position with a lower percentage time commitment or lower rate of pay than the position from which the employee was laid off. The balance of the severance pay is to be repaid in full at the time of reemployment, unless the employee authorizes and the university approves a reasonable schedule of repayment and payroll deduction, not to exceed one year in length, in writing on a form provided by University Human Resources - Employee & Labor Relations.\nAn employee may request other arrangements, and if approved, the schedule of repayment will be established by written agreement between the employee and the Vice President for Human Resources (or designee). (In the case of Senior Research Associates, Research Associates and all levels of Librarians, such other arrangements shall be between the employee and the Provost's Office.)\n2. Effect of Terminal Vacation on Severance Repayment: If the laid off employee elects to take terminal vacation as described in Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations, the new layoff effective date will be the last day of the terminal vacation period. The severance repayment period begins on the first business day following the layoff effective date. Any period of terminal vacation is not included in the years of benefit-eligible employment in calculating severance pay. \n7. Grievance\nInvoluntary termination due to layoff is subject to Guide Memo 2.1.11: Staff Grievance Policy. Only the decision to select the particular employee for layoff can be grieved.\nFootnote(s):\n1 When used in this Guide Memo, continuous university employment is the period of employment beginning with the employee's most recent hire date as a regular staff employee. Reinstatement of hire date after a break in service is described in Section 2.d of Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting & Hiring of Regular Staff.\n2 Base pay means the monthly salary of record and does not include any premium pay (e.g., shift differential, pay for overtime, or supplemental pay). Severance payment is calculated on the base monthly pay at the time of separation or the average base monthly pay earned over the preceding 12 months, whichever is greater."}

The policy is designed to give maximum flexibility to schools, departments and other organizational units while assuring compliance with federal and state regulations. The provisions of this policy apply only when an offer of employment is made. Allowances during the recruitment process are at the discretion of the vice president or vice provost for the area making the hiring decision (see Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses, section 13).\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to new and current Stanford faculty and staff except those covered by collective bargaining agreements. For policies that apply to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. \nWhile policy statements are applicable to the entire University, including SLAC, some of the interpretations of policy contained in this Guide Memo may be different at SLAC. Employees should contact the SLAC Travel Office for guidance regarding relocation policy interpretation at SLAC.\n1. Tax Implications\na. Reimbursement Reported as Additional Income\nWhen applying this relocation policy, departments should be aware that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the University to report any payments, reimbursements, and advances associated with the move of the employee, the employee’s immediate family, and their household goods and personal effects as additional compensation income to the employee, subject to payroll taxes.\n2. General Policies\na. Responsibility for Administering Policy\nThis policy is administered by the appropriate vice president, vice provost, dean or designee. Guidance on policy interpretation and procedural issues may be obtained from the Vice President for Human Resources and from the SLAC Travel Office.\nb. Responsibility for Relocation Costs\nThe unit approving the relocation bears all costs.\n(1) Charges to Sponsored Projects\nWhere costs are to be charged to a sponsored project, the terms of the applicable sponsored project award will take precedence.\n(2) Exceeding Relocation Allowances\nThe appropriate vice president, vice provost, dean or designee may authorize the reimbursement of actual moving expenses in excess of the relocation allowances stated in this policy.\nc. Reimbursement Authorization\nWhen an offer is made to pay moving expenses, a letter of authorization must be sent to the new employee at the time employment is offered. It is the responsibility of the department issuing the reimbursement request to be sure it complies with the letter of authorization. The letter of authorization must specify:\nReimbursable expenses and the maximum actual expenses that will be paid by the University\nAny lump sum amounts that would be in excess of actual expenses\nAny expenses subject to tax reporting and withholding\nd. Preferred Carriers\nThe department or the individual being moved can go to Moving Services for information.\n3. Eligibility\nRelocation allowances should be offered only when the University feels that payment of part or all of relocation expenses is a significant factor in being able to attract a potential employee to Stanford, or in being able to attract an employee to accept a temporary reassignment. Eligibility for relocation allowances does not establish an entitlement. Payment of relocation expenses to an eligible person is at the discretion of the hiring unit.\na. Stanford Employees\nEmployees eligible for taxable moving reimbursements and advances per IRS guidelines (see section 1) include:\nNew full-time employees whose new Stanford job location is at least 50 miles farther from their former home than their old job location was from their former home.\nCurrent full-time employees temporarily reassigned to a location 50 or more miles away. If such a reassignment is for less than a year, it is a Stanford business expense and not tax-reportable. Travel rules apply; see Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses. However, if relocation is for a year or more, relocation rules apply, as covered in this Guide Memo.\nExceptions to the eligibility criteria may be made by the appropriate vice president, vice provost, dean or designee.\nTax Note: Exceptions that do not meet IRS guidelines (for example: full-time employment or 50-mile distance) are tax-reportable to the employee.\nb. Spouses/Same-Sex Domestic Partners and Dependents\nRelocation costs for spouses/same-sex domestic partners and dependents are reimbursable to the extent described in this Guide Memo.\nTax Note: Domestic partner expense reimbursements are tax-reportable to the employee.\nc. Non-employees and Distinguished Visitors\nTravel reimbursements for non-employees and distinguished visitors are described in section 11 of this Guide Memo.\nTax Note: Any reimbursement of moving expenses for a part-time appointment is tax reportable.\n4. House-hunting Expenses\na. Policy\nAll or part of the expenses associated with a trip to Stanford for the purpose of house-hunting may be reimbursed to a prospective employee. Generally these may include those expenses reimbursable for travel by University employees (see Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses), except that the per diem method may not be used. However, the Per Diem Rates may be used as a guideline for defining reasonable costs.\nIn addition, the vice president, vice provost, dean or designee may authorize the following:\nExpenses related to bringing a spouse/same-sex domestic partner\nExpenses for necessary child care\nExpenses related to a professional relocation service\nReimbursement for house-hunting expenses does not apply to dependents other than to a spouse/same-sex domestic partner.\nb. Procedure\n— In any instance where house-hunting trip expenses are to be reimbursed by the University, the cognizant University officer should specify in writing to the prospective employee the terms and conditions of the reimbursement, including a maximum dollar amount to be reimbursed. It is the responsibility of the department issuing the reimbursement request to be sure it complies with the letter of authorization.

Mileage reimbursement is at the current Stanford rate (see Mileage Reimbursement Rates).\nb. Procedure\nSee section 4, House-hunting Expenses.\nc. Guidelines\nThe cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean or designee defines reasonable costs. If further guidance is needed the following guidelines are suggested:\nTransportation Costs — Airline tickets may be reimbursed. If a vehicle is driven, a typical minimum expectation for travel by personal auto is 350 to 400 miles per day.\nLodging, Meals and Gratuities — Although the per diem method may not be used for reimbursement, the per diem rates may be used as a guideline for defining reasonable costs.\nTax Note: Tax-reportable items in en route/travel expenses include:\nAll domestic partner expenses\nAirline tickets\nMeals and gratuities\nVehicle mileage allowance over the IRS approved mileage rate for moving (see Mileage Reimbursement Rates)\n6. Temporary Living Expenses\na. Policy\nA reasonable part (as defined by the cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean or designee) of the actual or incremental expenses associated with temporary living arrangements while relocating near the University may be reimbursed.\nb. Procedure\nSee section 4, House-Hunting Expenses.\nTax Note: All temporary living expenses are tax reportable, except for the day of departure from the old location and day of arrival in the new location.\n7.

Procedure\nThe letter of authorization should instruct the moving company to document the costs of packing, crating, transporting, uncrating, and unpacking laboratory effects separately from the costs of moving household effects.\n9. Auto Shipment\nThe vice president, vice provost, dean or designee may authorize all or part of the actual and reasonable expenses of moving two cars per household. The cars may be driven or shipped.\n10. Expenses for Return Trips to Former Residence\na. Policy\nIn a case where a new employee must return to their former residence to help with a move, or where the new employee is separated from their family for more than one month, the cognizant officer may authorize reimbursement for expenses relating to up to two trips to the employee's former residence.\nb. Procedure\nAny reimbursement should cover transportation costs only and should be confirmed in writing before the travel takes place. Receipts are required (see Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses.)\nTax Note: All expenses for return trips are tax reportable.\n11. Limited Assignment Expenses\na. Policy\nThe payment of expenses by the University may be authorized for faculty and regular staff with specifically limited assignments and for non-employees and distinguished visitors who perform teaching, research, or other related services. Limited assignments are for one calendar year or less and presuppose no change in permanent residence nor primary affiliation with another organization. All travel expense policies of the University (Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses) apply to limited assignments, with these points of clarification:\nb. Expenses are reimbursable\nonly to the extent authorized in a formal letter of authorization (invitation). Transportation expenses for dependents may be allowed at the discretion of the vice president, vice provost, dean or designee, but will not be allowed for an assignment of fewer than 30 days.\nTax Note: Limited assignment expenses are tax reportable unless these conditions occur:\nThe person on limited assignment has duplicate expenses (both the home residence and the limited assignment lodging).\nA member of the person's family continues to live in the home residence.\nThe person retains a primary affiliation to the home institution (i.e., to Stanford for employees on limited assignment elsewhere, to their other employer for visitors to Stanford).Tax Note: Dependent expenses for a person on limited assignment are tax reportable.\nc. Local transportation costs\nshould be held to a minimum by the use of University vehicles and public transportation, but car rentals and taxi expenses are reimbursable when necessary and reasonable, to the extent authorized in the letter of authorization.\nd. Reimbursement\nThe University will not reimburse expenses except those specifically detailed in the letter of authorization. Expenses reimbursed by other sources may not be included in the reimbursement request.\ne. Lodging\nWhile a person is seeking longer term suitable housing, payment by the University of actual and reasonable short term lodging costs or a per diem reimbursement is allowed, consistent with section 5 (En Route/Travel Expenses) of this Guide Memo. After suitable housing is obtained, a lodging allowance may be authorized if deemed necessary. A lodging allowance may be necessary if the employee has actual expenses greater than those incurred living in their primary residence. Any income from renting the primary residence while on temporary assignment must be considered in the lodging reimbursement calculation.\n12. Reassignment Expenses\nIf reassignment of a faculty or staff member for official University purposes requires relocation, the University may pay the actual, reasonable, and necessary costs incurred, as approved by the cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean, or designee, subject to a maximum agreed upon in writing in advance. Expense incurred in connection with sabbaticals (unless retained on salary by Stanford) and leaves of absence will not be reimbursed.\n13. Expense Advances\nWhere appropriate, the University may elect to advance a relocating employee an amount to cover anticipated expenditures. Such advances may cover only expenses reimbursable to the employee and must be made in accordance with Guide Memo 5.4.1, Expense Advances.\n14. Repayment Provisions\nFaculty or staff members who receive relocation assistance to accept a Stanford position will be required to reimburse the University for relocation assistance if they voluntarily leave the University for any reason within 12 months from their date of hire. Reimbursement to the University will be pro-rated according to the number of months the employee has worked at Stanford. (For example, an employee who leaves after six months would be required to repay half the relocation allowance paid.) This repayment provision must be included in the offer letter.\nTax Note: Non-repayment of relocation allowances has tax implications.\n15. Reimbursement Procedures\na. Oracle Financials Reimbursement Request\nTo claim reimbursement for relocation expenses the individual should submit an online Expense Report the through the Oracle Financials Expense Requests system. For requirements on receipts and other documentation, see Guide Memo 5.4.2, Business and Travel Expenses, section 14.\nb. Accounting\nRelocation expenses are coded to moving expense expenditure types. Most such costs are classified as allowable. However, if the employee voluntarily resigns within 12 months of hire, the net moving costs (that is, the portion not repaid) must be transferred to an unallowable moving expense expenditure type.\nc. Tax Withholding\nFor reimbursements on which income tax and Social Security withholding are required at the time of payment, Travel and Reimbursement will arrange with the Payroll Office for payment to be made through the payroll process."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/staff-employment-policies/remote-work-arrangements","text":"2.1.21 Remote Work Arrangements | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nMarch 20, 2024 \nEffective Date\nSeptember 20, 2021 \nPrint\nStanford University (Stanford) is committed to providing staff flexible work options in line with the operational needs of the university and their department. In appropriate circumstances, Stanford may hire or transition existing staff to work in Remote roles in which the individual’s primary workspace is at a location other than a Stanford location. This guide memo sets forth policies and procedures to facilitate Remote work arrangements for eligible employees in appropriate circumstances. For work arrangements where the employee’s primary work location is at Stanford, see Guide Memo 2.1.20: Hybrid (Telecommuting) Work Arrangements.\nApplicability: Applies to all employees, including regular employees, employees represented by SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007, Academic Staff-Research, Academic Staff-Libraries, and contingent (casual or temporary) employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions.\nThis policy does not apply to:\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining agreements other than SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007\nFaculty, Academic Staff-Teaching, Other Teaching Titles, Instructors, or Clinician Educators\nStudent employees\nEmployees who are working remotely outside the U.S. See Guide Memo 11.2.22.\nEmployees telecommuting temporarily but for an extended period outside the U.S. See Guide Memo 11.2.21.\n1. Policy Statement/Philosophy\nThe workplace culture at Stanford is one that is rooted in collaboration, continuous discourse about planned work and projects underway, and in providing stellar service to our university community. With appropriate use of technology and managerial oversight, staff whose roles allow for all work to be performed at a location that is not a Stanford location may be eligible for a Remote work arrangement. (“Remote” is defined below in section 2).\n2. Definitions\n“Stanford Campus” means the primary campus in Stanford, CA.\n“Stanford Satellite Office or Hub” means a Stanford location other than the Stanford Campus which allows the university to spread its operations across multiple regions/locations. These include Stanford Redwood City (SRWC), SLAC, Stanford Research Park, Hopkins Marine Station, the Newark satellite hub, and other locations.\n“Stanford Alternative Worksite” means Stanford-leased premises, outside of the Stanford Campus and Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, where individuals can schedule a designated work space at least one day per week. The alternative worksite provides an office environment with a variety of workspace amenities, free of home distractions.\n\"Stanford Work Location\" includes the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite.\n“Primary Stanford Work Location” means the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite designated by Stanford as the primary location available to the employee to perform their work.\n“Remote” means a role in which a Stanford employee is approved or designated by Stanford to work from home or at a site other than a Stanford Work Location and the employee is not required to have a regular presence on-site to perform their duties as outlined under a hybrid work arrangement (defined in Guide Memo 2.1.20: Hybrid (Telecommuting) Work Arrangements). This also includes an employee who is approved or designated by Stanford to telecommute on a full-time but temporary basis (more than 4 consecutive weeks) from a location other than the employee’s Primary Stanford Work Location or other Stanford Work Location. Although Remote employees may be required to come to a Stanford Work Location infrequently or on limited occasions (e.g., generally no more than a few days total each quarter), this would not change their Remote status.\n3. Eligibility\na. Eligibility Criteria\nSome departments may have work conducive to hiring Remote staff. When considering whether a Remote work arrangement is appropriate, managers should take into consideration, among other factors, the nature of the work, costs described in Section 4 below, whether the department can maintain the quality and effectiveness of their services to members of the university community with an employee working in a Remote role, and whether the work should or must be performed remotely.\nWhen an existing employee wishes to transition to work remotely, managers should take into consideration applicable factors listed above, performance and productivity of the employee, and the ability of the employee to work independently.\nDecisions about the suitability of Remote work arrangements are discretionary and require approval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee as well as the local senior HR Manager.\n4. Requirements\na. General Requirements\nEmployees in a Remote work arrangement must comply with all Stanford policies and procedures, including the appropriate handling of confidential information.\nEmployees in a Remote work arrangement are expected to remain available and accessible during regularly-scheduled and approved work hours, as determined by the department. Employees may be required to attend meetings and functions in person.\nNon-exempt employees are required to strictly adhere to required rest and meal breaks, and to accurately report their work hours as set forth in Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees. Non-exempt employees must obtain prior approval before working any overtime.\nEmployees in a Remote work arrangement are expected to make dependent care arrangements during regularly-scheduled work hours.\nRemote employees are paid competitive rates based on the geographic region where they work. To ensure consistent, equitable application of our compensation program, University Human Resources--Staff Compensation will work in partnership with local HR Managers to review and approve the compensation of all employees in Remote work arrangements, including newly hired employees, employees transitioning into an approved Remote work arrangement, and employees who move and change their Remote work location. The university may adjust salary rates for employees who transition into a Remote work arrangement or who move and change their Remote work location consistent with the foregoing. Employees in Remote work arrangements must obtain approval in advance from the department and the local senior HR Manager, and inform Stanford Benefits if they plan to move their Remote work location to a different city or state. In addition, the department should review the provisions of Guide Memo 2.2.2: Out-of-State Employees and Fingate with respect to out-of-state payroll for Remote employees working in the U.S. but outside of California.\nFor Remote employees whose residence is within a 10-county area*, travel to a Stanford Work Location will not be reimbursed because the remote arrangement is at the employee’s request and there is space available for the employee to work on campus. For other Remote employees, Stanford will reimburse expenses for occasional, required travel to a Stanford Work Location as long as the travel is necessarily incurred and the employee receives prior approval by the employee’s department/manager.\n*The 10-county area includes all of the following counties: Santa Clara County, San Mateo County, San Francisco County, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Marin County, Napa County, Sonoma County, Solano County, or Santa Cruz County.\nRemote employees must be provided with appropriate reimbursement for required and approved Stanford-related business travel, in accordance with Stanford’s travel reimbursement policies.\nRemote work arrangements must be approved by the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department as well as the local senior HR Manager. Employees who are approved for a Remote work arrangement must sign the Remote Work Agreement, and any other documents the department or university may require. The Remote Work Agreement should be reviewed and renewed by the manager and employee periodically but no less frequently than annually.\nHR Managers or their delegates are required to ensure all employees in an approved Remote work arrangement have a Remote Work Agreement that complies with this policy and is signed by the employee, manager, local senior HR Manager and the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department. In addition, HR Managers or their delegates must keep the HR information system up-to-date with the location from which the employee works. The Remote Work Agreement may specify an end date; however, even if an end date is specified, the university reserves the right to modify or discontinue the agreement.\nRemote employees must obtain approval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department, or their designee, as well as the local senior HR Manager if they wish to relocate their remote workspace to a different city, state and/or country, prior to such relocation.\nRemote work arrangements may be modified on an ongoing basis or discontinued at any time at the university’s sole discretion, or at the request of the employee, with reasonable notice, typically four (4) weeks. In such an event, the department may consider offering the Remote employee the opportunity to work at a Stanford Work Location that the department deems appropriate, but is under no obligation to do so. Nothing in this Administrative Guide Memo requires the department to retain a Remote employee whom the department would otherwise terminate or lay off, consistent with university policies.\nb. Equipment\nGenerally, the university does not maintain an equipped workspace at a Stanford Work Location for Remote employees. Accordingly, departments are required to provide reasonable reimbursement for and/or supply the equipment, services and supplies deemed by the university to be reasonable and necessary to enable Remote employees to perform their Stanford work, all in accordance with Stanford’s policies governing reimbursement of business expenses. Employees in Remote work arrangements will be provided with a one-time taxable payment of $750 to purchase basic home office equipment to ensure a productive and safe home work environment. For additional information regarding basic home office equipment purchasing resources and ergonomic needs, see Home Office Equipment and Expense Guidelines.\nEmployees approved or designated by their department to work under a Remote work arrangement are responsible to ensure that their remote workspace is ergonomically appropriate by completing an ergonomic assessment through EH&S. See Stanford’s Ergonomics Program.\nEmployees who are approved or designated by their department to work under a Remote work arrangement are responsible to ensure their remote workspace has adequate internet connectivity to perform their work, including video conferencing.\nEmployees in Remote work arrangements are eligible for a stipend for cell phone and/or home Internet connectivity as outlined in Guide Memo 8.1.3: Provision of Mobile Equipment and Related Services. \n5. Procedure\nCurrent employees who wish to transition to a Remote work arrangement should discuss their request with their manager.\nThe manager will review the request with their local senior HR Manager and the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee of the department, or their designee.\nIf the department believes a Remote work arrangement may be suitable, the employee should complete the Remote Work Agreement and send it to their manager for review.

Flexible work encompasses a broad spectrum of approaches, including Hybrid work arrangements where staff may work from home, although their primary work location continues to be at Stanford. This guide memo sets forth policies and procedures to facilitate Hybrid work arrangements for eligible employees in appropriate circumstances. For work arrangements where the employee’s primary work location is at home or other location, see Guide Memo 2.1.21: Remote Work Arrangements.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all employees, including regular employees, employees represented by SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007, Academic Staff-Research, Academic Staff-Libraries, and contingent (casual or temporary) employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions.\nThis policy does not apply to:\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining agreements other than SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007\nFaculty, Academic Staff-Teaching, Other Teaching Titles, Instructors, or Clinician Educators\nStudent employees\nEmployees who are working remotely outside the U.S. See Guide Memo 11.2.22.\nEmployees telecommuting temporarily but for an extended period outside the U.S. See Guide Memo 11.2.21.\n1. Policy Statement/Philosophy\nThe workplace culture at Stanford is one that is rooted in collaboration, continuous discourse about planned work and projects underway, and in providing stellar service to our university community. With appropriate use of technology and managerial oversight, staff whose roles allow for work to be performed away from their Primary Stanford Work Location may be eligible for a Hybrid work arrangement. (“Primary Stanford Work Location” and “Hybrid” are defined below in section 2).\n2. Definitions\n“Stanford Campus” means the primary campus in Stanford, CA.\n“Stanford Satellite Office or Hub” means a Stanford location other than the Stanford Campus which allows the university to spread its operations across multiple regions/locations. These include Stanford Redwood City (SRWC), SLAC, Stanford Research Park, Hopkins Marine Station, the Newark satellite hub, and other locations.\n“Stanford Alternative Worksite” means Stanford-leased premises, outside of the Stanford Campus and Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, where individuals can schedule a designated work space at least one day per week. The alternative worksite provides an office environment with a variety of workspace amenities, free of home distractions.\n“Stanford Work Location” includes the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite.\n“Primary Stanford Work Location” means the Stanford Campus, Stanford Satellite Office or Hub, or Stanford Alternative Worksite designated by Stanford as the primary location available to the employee to perform their work.\n“Hybrid” means a role that the university determines is suitable to be performed to some varying extent off-site and for which a Stanford employee requests and is approved by Stanford to work in different work locations (e.g., mix of Primary Stanford Work Location and their home or other location). Individuals in a Hybrid work arrangement have a Primary Stanford Work Location designated by the university. Hybrid roles require a regular presence at the employee's Primary Stanford Work Location. Required regular presence is determined by the employee’s department or unit and is typically two, three, or four days per week or an equivalent amount of time monthly. Managers are generally expected to arrange their in-person work so there is adequate staffing on-site. Managers who believe their operational needs warrant a regular cadence for hybrid that is less than an average of two days per week or less than a similar amount of time monthly, should discuss this with their Dean, Vice Provost, or Vice President (or their delegate) as well as the local senior HR Manager to obtain approval.\n“Telecommute” or “telecommuting” means performing Stanford work on a regular, part-time basis as part of a Hybrid work arrangement from a location other than the employee’s Primary Stanford Work Location, provided the location is not a Stanford Work Location.\n3. Eligibility\na. Eligibility Criteria\nHybrid work arrangements should only be considered at the employee’s request.\nManagers should take into consideration, among other factors, the nature of the work, operational needs, whether the department can maintain the quality and effectiveness of their services to members of the university community, performance and productivity of the employee, attendance and the ability of the employee to work independently. \nGenerally, managers will determine the specific procedures for evaluating, approving or denying a request for a Hybrid work arrangement in a manner consistent with this policy and school/unit guidelines. (For additional information, see Flexible Work on the Cardinal at Work website.)\nDecisions about the suitability of Hybrid work arrangements are discretionary and typically made by the department in consultation with local HR.\n4. Requirements\na. General Requirements\nEmployees in a Hybrid work arrangement must comply with all Stanford policies and procedures, including the appropriate handling of confidential information.\nAt all times, employees in a Hybrid work arrangement will have access to a fully equipped workspace at their Primary Stanford Work Location. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement are not required to telecommute. Employees in a Hybrid work arrangement can choose to work at their Primary Stanford Work Location on any regularly scheduled day, including on days when they would normally telecommute.\nEmployees in a Hybrid work arrangement are expected to remain available and accessible during regularly-scheduled and approved work hours, as determined by the department. Employees may be required to attend meetings and functions in person, including on days they would customarily telecommute if in a Hybrid work arrangement.\nHybrid work arrangements for non-exempt employees can only include full workdays on-site or at their telecommuting worksite. Non-exempt employees are required to strictly adhere to required rest and meal breaks, and to accurately report their work hours as set forth in Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees. Non-exempt employees must obtain prior approval before working any overtime.\nEmployees in a Hybrid work arrangement are expected to make dependent care arrangements during regularly-scheduled work hours.\nFor approved Hybrid work arrangements, travel between an employee’s telecommuting worksite and their Primary Stanford Work Location is considered part of an employee’s normal commute and associated expenses are not reimbursable. Employees who have requested and been approved to be Hybrid are not entitled to reimbursement for travel to a Stanford Work Location because the employee has requested a more flexible work arrangement even though a workspace at a Stanford Work Location is available on a daily basis.\nEmployees who are approved to work a Hybrid work arrangement must sign the Hybrid Work Agreement, and any other documents the department or university may require. The Hybrid Work Agreement should be reviewed and renewed by the manager and employee periodically but no less frequently than annually.\nHR Managers or their delegates are required to ensure all employees in an approved Hybrid work arrangement have a Hybrid Work Agreement that complies with this policy and is signed by the employee, manager and HR Manager. In addition, HR Managers or their delegates must keep the HR information system up-to-date with the employee’s Primary Stanford Work Location and the location from which the employee in a Hybrid work arrangement telecommutes. Such records must also include the frequency of the Hybrid work arrangement. The Hybrid Work Agreement may specify an end date; however, whether an end date is specified, the university reserves the right to modify or discontinue the agreement.\nHybrid work arrangements may be modified on an ongoing basis or discontinued at any time at the university’s sole discretion, or at the request of the employee, with reasonable notice, typically two (2) weeks.\nb. Equipment\nEmployees approved to telecommute as part of a Hybrid work arrangement are responsible to ensure that their telecommuting worksite is ergonomically appropriate. Employees who do not have or are not able to provide themselves an ergonomically appropriate place to work should not telecommute under a Hybrid work arrangement and should work instead at their Primary Stanford Work Location.\nEmployees working in approved Hybrid work arrangements are eligible to purchase or be reimbursed up to $250 for basic necessary ergonomic equipment for their telecommuting worksite only to the extent such equipment is recommended by Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) following an ergonomic assessment. Reimbursement of expenses or the purchase of the equipment by the department will occur only after the employee completes all required steps outlined in the Stanford Ergonomics Program available on the EH&S website at ehs.stanford.edu. For additional information regarding basic home office equipment purchasing resources and ergonomic needs, see Home Office Equipment and Expense Guidelines.\nEmployees who are approved by their department to telecommute as part of a Hybrid work arrangement are responsible to ensure their telecommuting worksite is equipped with adequate internet connectivity to perform their work, including video conferencing. \nSince the university provides a fully-equipped Primary Stanford Work Location for employees in Hybrid work arrangements, it generally does not provide reimbursement for cell phone or home Internet connectivity unless there is a demonstrated business necessity. Please refer to Guide Memo 8.1.3: Provision of Mobile Equipment and Related Services.\n5. Procedure\nEmployees should discuss their request for a Hybrid work arrangement with their manager.\nIf the manager believes a Hybrid work arrangement may be suitable, the employee should complete the Hybrid Work Agreement and send it to their manager for review. (Managers can obtain the agreement through their HR Manager.)\nIf approved, the employee, manager and HR Manager should sign the Hybrid Work Agreement and follow all requirements in this policy."}

General Information\na. Administration of Insurance\nThe Risk Management and Insurance Office is responsible for obtaining insurance and self-insurance coverage and processing all claims.\nb. Who Pays for Insurance\nRisk Management charges income-producing operations, formula schools, auxiliaries, and general funds for their Aggregate Annual Insurance Premiums.\nc. Special Insurance Coverage\nAny department having special risks that it feels should be insured should discuss the issue with Risk Management. If insurance does appear to be the best way of managing a risk, Risk Management will negotiate a policy with the insurance carrier and rebill the cost to the requesting department.\nd. What to do in the Event of an Accident\n(1) Emergency Action\nTake whatever steps are immediately necessary to render emergency medical care, salvage property, or reduce the further extent of the loss. If anyone is injured, see Guide Memo 7.2.1: Emergency/Accident Procedures, for emergency procedures, and Guide Memo 7.6.1: Accident and Incident Reporting, for reporting requirements. Report injuries promptly to comply with state law.\n(2) Evidence for Insurance Claim\nIf possible, do not disturb the evidence or hazard which caused the claim until the area can be inspected, pictures taken, and conditions recorded. Obtain the names and addresses of parties involved, witnesses, etc. Under no circumstances should one admit liability; to do so could jeopardize the insurance coverage. As soon as possible record the details of the accident. The report should include: the date, time, place, who or what was involved, how it happened, names, addresses, and estimated ages of persons involved; description of injury, loss, or damage; and action that was or will be taken to prevent a recurrence. All claims must be reported immediately to Risk Management.\n2. Property Insurance\na. General Property Insurance \n(1) Situations Covered\nStanford's insurance and self-insurance on buildings and their contents, including other physical assets such as owned/rented/loaned equipment, and includes coverage for fire, water damage, smoke, windstorm, explosion, riot, civil commotion, vandalism, malicious mischief, falling aircraft, and theft, subject to department or school deductible.\n(2) Situations not Covered\nThe university does not provide insurance coverage for the following situations:\nDamage caused by rough wear and tear, rust, dust, mechanical failure, maintenance problems, breakage, scratching, marring, and staining\nItems identified as lost as a result of inventory\nFailed experiments, or lost or damaged research efforts\nManagement errors, financial decisions, or lost income or opportunities\nGovernment-owned property\nPersonal property of faculty, staff, or students\nDamage caused by earthquake\nDamage caused by terrorism or bioterrorism, except damage due to terrorism as defined by TRIA (Terrorism Risk Insurance Act) is covered.\nIn any country where trade relations are unlawful, as determined by the Government of the United States of America or its agencies, are not covered. In addition, other countries may be excluded from time to time. Please see the Risk Management and Insurance website for a current list of excluded countries.\n(3) Deductible\nThe first $1,500,000 of each claim is self-insured by the university. The department that suffered the loss or damage of property pays for the first $10,000 of each claim. \n(4) Claim Processing\nRisk Management processes all claims for the replacement value or repair of University property that has been stolen, destroyed, or damaged. Depending upon the type, size, and location of the loss, Procurement or Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE) will be directly involved in the repairs or reconstruction. The preparation of specifications and a bidding process may be necessary. Risk Management must receive copies of all contracts, work orders, and purchase requisitions.\nIn the event a claim exceeds $10,000, insurance or self-insurance may pay for repair or replacement value (whichever is less). \"Replacement value\" means the cost to repair or replace (not book value). Loss settlements are based on the cost to repair or replace with like kind and quality. Any upgrading will be at the cost of the department that suffers the loss. If property is not to be replaced (due to obsolescence or no continuing need or use for the property) insurance proceeds will not be based on the actual cash or depreciated value.\nb. Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Heavy Machinery\n(1) Situations Covered\nInsurance covers explosion, burning, bulging, and cracking of insured objects; machinery and equipment are covered for sudden and accidental breakdown.\n(2) Deductible\nThe first $1,500,000 of each claim is self-insured by the university. The first $10,000 of each claim loss is the responsibility of the department, the full amount of which is coordinated with LBRE/Buildings and Grounds Maintenance (or the department if it is a service center, an income-producing operation, or an auxiliary).\nc. Budgeting Total Property Insurance Expense\nTotal Property Insurance Expense includes General Property Insurance and Boilers, Pressure Vessels, and Heavy Machinery Insurance. Following the end of each fiscal year, the Risk Management department will secure an actuarial study of claims under the Property Insurance Program. The actuarial study will provide two key figures that will be used to budget future property insurance expenses:\nSelf-insurance reserve required to fund claims (and related expenses) that have occurred prior to the end of the recently completed fiscal year but have not yet been settled/completed. (This can be an accumulation of several years of claims estimates, net of settlements). This actuarial required reserve may be higher or lower than the actual reserve balance at Fiscal Year End.\nActuarial projected self-insurance funding levels, or cost of claims and expenses that will be incurred in the next fiscal year. This will be the amount added to the reserve balance each year to cover claims incurred in that year.\nDuring the budget planning cycle (and no later than February 1), Risk Management will provide the Budget Office with the Aggregate Annual Premium to be charged internally for Property Insurance during the next fiscal year. At the same time, Risk Management will also provide the income-producing operations, formula schools, and auxiliaries with their respective property premium allocation to be charged during the next fiscal year. The Aggregate Premium will be composed of the following four elements:\nActuarial Projection of self-insurance funding for the cost of claims and expenses that will be incurred in the budget year.\nRisk Management's estimate of premiums to be paid to outside insurers for excess coverage insurance during the next fiscal year.\nRisk Management's estimate of other direct expenses (e.g., actuarial studies, legal expenses, brokerage fees, operating expenses) associated with the Property Insurance Program.\nAdjustment for the under or over funded reserve account, based on the actuarial project of the required reserve balance, is explained in 1.b. This is intended to provide a smoothing effect to avoid large year-to-year changes in the Aggregate Premium.\nThe Aggregate Annual Premium is allocated to income-producing operations, formula schools, auxiliaries, and general funds based on property replacement values.\n3. Transit Insurance\na. Situations Covered\nStanford's insurance on transit covers all goods shipped inland to or by Stanford when the transit agreement assigns the risk to Stanford.

In addition, other countries may be excluded from time to time. Please see the Risk Management and Insurance website for a current list of excluded countries.\nc. Deductible\nThe first $1,500,000 of each claim is self-insured by the university. The first $10,000 of each claim loss is the responsibility of the department.\nd. Claim Processing\nImmediate notification of loss to Risk Management is required for losses greater than $5,000.

Deductible\n(1) General Liability\nThe first $3,000,000 of each claim for general liability is self-insured by the university.\n(2) Employee and/or Student Relations\nThe first $3,000,000 of each claim for liability claims involving student and/or employee relations is self-insured by the university.\nd. Claim Processing\nUpon becoming aware of an incident, which could lead to a liability claim or when a claim for liability is received, the department should immediately notify Risk Management.\ne. Budgeting Liability Insurance Expense\nLiability Insurance includes General Liability, Educators Legal Liability, Automotive, Non-owned Aviation, and Crime Insurance. Following the end of each fiscal year, the Risk Management department will secure an actuarial study of claims under the Liability Insurance Program. The actuarial study will provide two key figures that will be used to budget future liability insurance expenses:\nSelf-insurance reserve required to fund claims (and related expenses) that have occurred prior to the end of the recently completed fiscal year but have not yet been settled/completed. (This can be an accumulation of many years of claims estimates, net of settlements) This actuarial required reserve may be higher or lower than the actual reserve balance at Fiscal Year End.\nActuarial projected self-insurance funding levels, or cost of claims and expenses that will be incurred in the next fiscal year. (This will be the amount added to the reserve balance each year to cover claims incurred in that year.)\nDuring the budget planning cycle (and no later than February 1), Risk Management will provide the Budget Office with the Aggregate Annual Premium to be charged internally for Liability Insurance during the next fiscal year. At the same time, Risk Management will also provide the income-producing operations, formula schools, and auxiliaries with their respective liability premium allocation to be charged during the next fiscal year.

This is intended to provide a smoothing effect to avoid large year-to-year changes in the Aggregate Premium.\n(3) Allocation of Liability Insurance Expense\nThe Aggregate Annual Premium is allocated to income-producing operations, formula schools, auxiliaries, and general funds based on the prior year's actual payroll and five year's rolling claims data.\nVehicle insurance premiums are allocated on a per-vehicle basis and are not included in the Liability Aggregate Annual Premium calculations.\n5. Crime Insurance\na. Situations Covered\nCrime insurance covers loss of monies and securities due to robbery, burglary, theft, or employee dishonesty.\nb. Situations Not Covered\nOnce a loss due to the dishonesty of an employee becomes known, the insurance company will not pay for any future losses caused by that employee. Departments must report claims promptly and take action to prevent or reduce further loss.\nc. Deductible\nThe first $1,500,000 of each claim is self-insured by the university.\nd. Claim Processing\n(1) Police Report\nThe department must notify the Police Department immediately (see Guide Memo 2.4.5: Protection of Property.\n(2) Internal Audit Report\nThe department must notify the Internal Audit department, which will conduct an audit of procedures and policies and make recommendations to strengthen internal controls to help prevent a recurrence of losses.\n(3) Insurance Claim\nThe department must contact the Risk Management office for assistance and instructions on processing a claim.\ne.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/human-resources/employment-benefit-programs/disability-and-family-leaves","text":"2.3.5 Disability and Family Leaves\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 27.7\nThis Guide Memo describes medical and other disability-type leaves, and the coordination of these types of leave with University benefit plans.\nApplicability:\nApplies to regular Stanford University employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, regular Academic Staff - Research, and regular Academic Staff - Libraries. (The term \"regular employee\" is defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions.) For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. \nNotes:\nProcedures for SLAC employees may vary.\nFaculty may consult the Faculty Handbook, chapter 3.\nSee information on each disability plan for specific details about plan eligibility.\n1. Overview\nEligible University employees can participate in a variety of family and medical leaves and disability benefit plans. Policies are described in this document. Before you go out on leave, consult with your local Human Resources office. Important information regarding the scope and use of the disability benefit plans is included in the relevant plan brochures available on the Cardinal at Work website.\na. Specific Process for filing a disability claim:\nThe employee reports the absence (or planned absence) to their immediate supervisor.\nThe employee calls Stanford's disability administrator to initiate a claim. The disability administrator will inform the employee if there are any forms or certification documents to submit.\nIf the employee does not call the disability administrator, it is the department's responsibility to notify the disability administrator.\nContinue steps per general process for all disabilities in section 1.b.\nb. General Process:\n(1) Timeliness\nEmployees must give notice of anticipated family or medical leaves and file claims for disability plan benefits as soon as feasible. Notice should be given to the immediate supervisor, the local Human Resources office and the disability administrator. For work-related leaves, refer to section 4, Workers' Compensation. For example, an employee who will be hospitalized on a pre-determined date should contact the disability administrator before entering the hospital. In addition, the employee must submit the signed Authorization to Release Information form to their physician's office as soon as possible. No disability benefits can be paid until the disability administrator has received the completed physician's form with appropriate verification of the disability. If not hospitalized, the employee still needs to report the absence to the disability administrator and their supervisor.\n(2) Workers' Compensation\nWhen the employee's disability is, or may be, work-related, the department should report the circumstances to the Risk Management Office within 24 hours of the employee's injury. See section 4, Workers' Compensation. SLAC employees should refer to SLAC Human Resources for the relevant reporting requirements.\n(3) The local Human Resources office\nThe local Human Resources office notifies and coordinates with the disability administrator. The local Human Resources office works with the employee, their supervisor and the disability administrator to ensure that information is communicated in a timely manner.\n(4) DLS\nDisability and Leave Services (DLS) in University Human Resources updates employee's record in the Human Resources Management System (HRMS) and works with the disability administrator to ensure accurate time card reporting and pay.\n(5) Supervisor's Ongoing Communication\nThe supervisor (or local Human Resources office on the supervisor's behalf) should routinely check the determination made on the employee's claim for short-term (VDI/SDI) disability benefit or Workers' Compensation benefit payments. The supervisor should arrange with the employee to be kept informed about the estimated return to work date for an employee who is absent for an extended period. If the employee is unable to advise the supervisor personally about their inability to return to work, the supervisor should make other arrangements to be kept advised of the status of the employee's return to work.\n(6) Medical Certification\nThe employee must contact the disability administrator to initiate a leave request and open a disability or Paid Family Leave (PFL) claim, who will then work with the employee to obtain the necessary certification from a health care provider. The employee must provide certification within 15 days to the disability administrator. Certification is also required to request a leave extension.\n(7) Length of Leave\nMaximum Duration - Except as otherwise required by law, the maximum duration that a regular employee is eligible to be on an approved medical leave of absence due to a non-work-related injury or illness is no more than 12 consecutive months, inclusive of any periods of full- or part-time leave, Family Medical leave, pregnancy disability leave, or leave for personal reasons. If, through the interactive process, it is determined that an employee is unable to return to work at the end of an approved medical leave with or without reasonable accommodations, the employee will be terminated. Twelve months of leave is not guaranteed. The maximum duration of leave will be determined based on the particular circumstances of the situation, including the operational needs of the department, the number of times extensions of leave have been previously granted, and any disability accommodation leave that may have been granted.\nExceptions - If a proposed leave will result in a total period of absence exceeding 12 months, prior approval is required from the local Human Resources office and in concurrence with the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee). Requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing to the local Human Resources office. Such exceptions are likely to be approved only in limited circumstances.\n2. Family and Medical Leaves\na. Introduction\nFamily Medical Leave is leave authorized by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the California Family Rights Act (CFRA). Certain leaves for members of the armed forces and their families are outlined in Guide Memo 2.1.18. In most cases, FMLA and CFRA run concurrently with each other and with Short-Term Disability Leave, including leave due to work-related illness or injury, and with Paid Family Leave (PFL). Eligible employees are assured up to 12 weeks unpaid leave during a rolling 12-month period that begins on the verified FMLA/CFRA start date. \"Assured\" means the department cannot refuse the leave when any one of the following situations is appropriately verified:\nThe birth of a child or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. Under CFRA, if both parents are employed by Stanford, each parent is eligible for up to 12 weeks of baby bonding leave.Limitations: Leave for birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care should generally be taken in blocks of time (two weeks minimum) and must be concluded within the first 12 months after the birth or placement. A request for baby bonding leave in less than two weeks' duration may be granted on any two occasions.\nA serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform their job.\nUnder FMLA, the serious health condition of a spouse, same-sex domestic partner, parent or child that requires the employee's absence from work to care for the ill family member.\nUnder CFRA, the serious health condition of a child, parent, parent-in-law (parent of a spouse or domestic partner), grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, domestic partner, or designated person that requires the employee’s absence from work to care for the ill family member. “Designated person” means any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. The “designated person” may be identified by the employee at the time leave is requested. An employee is limited to one “designated person” per 12-month period.\nDefinition of \"Serious Health Condition\"\nSerious health condition (as defined by the Dept. of Labor) means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either:\nInpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical-care facility, including any period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend school, or perform other regular daily activities) or subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or\nContinuing treatment by a health care provider, which includes: \nA period of incapacity lasting more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition that also includes:\ntreatment two or more times by or under the supervision of a health care provider (i.e., in-person visits, the first within 7 days and both within 30 days of the first day of incapacity); or\none treatment by a health care provider (i.e., an in-person visit within 7 days of the first day of incapacity) with a continuing regimen of treatment (e.g., prescription medication, physical therapy); or\nAny period of incapacity related to pregnancy or for prenatal care. A visit to the health care provider is not necessary for each absence; or\nAny period of incapacity or treatment for a chronic serious health condition that continues over an extended period, requires periodic visits (at least twice a year) to a health care provider, and may involve occasional episodes of incapacity. A visit to a health care provider is not necessary for each absence; or\nA period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. Only supervision by a health care provider is required, rather than active treatment; or\nAny absences to receive multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three days if not treated.\nb. Eligibility\nEmployees working in the U.S. are eligible if employed by Stanford at least one year and have worked at least 1,250 hours (paid time off, paid leave and unpaid leave not included) during the 12 months before the start of the requested leave.\nc. Notification\nEmployees are expected to provide 30 days advance notice to their manager when the need for leave is foreseeable (i.e., anticipated date of birth, adoption or planned medical treatment). When advance notice is not possible, employees should give as much advance notice as feasible. If advance notice is not provided when the employee had sufficient prior knowledge of the need for leave, the department may deny leave until 30 days have elapsed. Such denial should be made only when operationally necessary, and always in consultation with the local Human Resources office. Employees are required to give a minimum of two days' notice if the return to work will be later or earlier than the expected return date.\nd. Medical Certification\nThe employee must call the disability administrator to request FMLA/CFRA leave. The disability administrator will work with the employee to obtain certification from a health care provider that the employee, their child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner has a serious health condition, the condition's expected duration, and the need for the employee to attend to the family member. The employee must provide certification within 15 days to the disability administrator. Certification is also required to request a leave extension.\ne. Intermittent Leave\nUnder some circumstances, employees may take FMLA/CFRA leave intermittently (taking leave in separate blocks of time for a single qualifying reason) or on a reduced schedule (reducing the employee's usual weekly or daily work schedule). When leave is needed for planned medical treatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment to avoid unduly disrupting department operations.\nFor birth and care of a child or \"baby bonding\" under California (CFRA) law, an employee may use intermittent leave in segments of two weeks. A request for baby bonding leave of less than two weeks duration may be granted on any two occasions.\n3. Pregnancy and Disability Leave\nCalifornia law currently provides eligible employees up to four months off for pregnancy disability leave (PDL). The first three months of PDL run concurrently with the employee's federal FMLA entitlement. Following PDL, the employee may be eligible to use up to 12 weeks of California Family Rights Act (CFRA) leave. Verified pregnancy disability leave does not count against an employee's California Family Rights Act (CFRA) leave entitlement unless the employee has exhausted the maximum pregnancy disability leave permitted by law.\n4. Paid Organ Donor Leave\na. Introduction\nUnder California law, eligible employees are entitled to a paid leave of absence up to 30 days for the purpose of organ donation and up to five days for bone marrow donation. For organ donation, eligible employees are entitled to an additional unpaid leave of absence up to 30 days.\nThe leave may be taken in increments during any one-year period. The one-year period starts on the first day of leave. Use of accrued time for a portion of the leave will be required (see section 4.d). Periods of authorized Paid Organ Donor leave do not run concurrently with either FMLA or CFRA leave and are not counted against an employee's annual FMLA/CFRA entitlement.\nb. Eligibility\nThe employee must complete at least 90 days of service with the University before requesting Paid Organ Donor leave.\nc. Medical Certification\nThe employee must call the disability administrator to request a Paid Organ Donor leave and provide written medical verification that the employee is an organ or bone marrow donor and the medical necessity for the donation. The disability administrator must receive the certification within 15 days of the Paid Organ Donor leave request.\nd. Pay During Leave\nDuring the period of Paid Organ Donor leave, employees will be required to use five days of accrued time for bone marrow donation and 10 days for organ donation. Once the amount of required accrued time is used, the employee will be on a paid leave of absence for up to 30 days for organ donation and five days for bone marrow donation.\n5. Workers' Compensation\na. Introduction\nThe purpose of this coverage is to provide partial income continuation during absences resulting from work-related injuries or illnesses, and payment of necessary medical, surgical, and hospital services for such injuries and illnesses. The university pays the full cost of Workers' Compensation coverage. Workers' Compensation payments are a non-taxable benefit paid directly to the employee by a third party administrator.\nb. Eligibility\nAll employees of the university, including student employees, staff, and faculty, are covered by Workers' Compensation. Work-related disability provisions are applicable to temporary, student and casual employees; however, the charging (or not charging) of vacation and/or sick time is not applicable.\nc. Reporting and Recording Work Injuries and Related Absences From Work\nDepartments have additional requirements for reporting all work-related injuries and illnesses. See Guide Memo 7.6.1: Accident and Incident Reporting.\nd. Payments\nThe Workers' Compensation administrator normally pays benefits from the fourth day of the disability period or the first day of hospitalization, whichever occurs first. If the employee is out of work more than 14 days (need not be consecutive) with a doctor's authorization, the three-day waiting period is waived and retroactive payments will be made so that payments start with the first day of disability. For Workers' Compensation, Stanford charges up to the initial five full work days of absence (days need not be consecutive) of an accepted claim to work-related disability paid leave. The university will augment the Workers' Compensation benefit with salary during this period. An employee's sick time or vacation is not charged for these days of absence. By state law, an employee may not receive both Workers' Compensation benefits and full pay. Therefore, employees are required to reimburse the university for any Workers' Compensation benefits paid for the first five days including any associated holidays, because the university has already paid the employee for the time. For part-time employees, the full day is prorated based on the employee's normal work schedule.\ne. Delayed Claims\nIf acceptance of a claim is delayed, the initial five full days of absence (need not be consecutive) are charged to accumulated sick time and the claim is handled as a short-term non-work-related disability. If accumulated sick time is exhausted, the time is charged to accrued PTO, floating holiday and vacation, in that order. If the employee does not have enough accrued time, the remaining hours are unpaid. If the claim is then accepted under Workers' Compensation, any sick, PTO, floating holiday, and /or vacation time taken during the first five days will be restored.\nf. Supplementing Workers' Compensation Payments\nEmployees may receive both paid leave and disability plan benefits concurrently, not to exceed the employee's base pay. After the initial five work days of disability, accumulated sick, PTO, floating holiday and vacation time will be used, in that order, to supplement Workers' Compensation benefits. Thus, the employee continues to receive income equivalent to full pay.\ng. Role of Disability and Leave Services\nDisability and Leave Services (DLS) within University Human Resources updates the Human Resources Management System (HRMS) records each pay period for all employees on absences due to work-related disability. DLS makes certain that combined income from disability payments and Stanford does not exceed pre-disability pay and keeps accurate records of leave time used.\nh. More Information\nDetails regarding claims procedures, accident reports, and related matters may be obtained from the Risk Management Office, (650) 723-7400, Workers' Compensation Benefits. Also, Guide Memo 7.6.1: Accident and Incident Reporting, has additional information about Workers' Compensation. SLAC employees should refer to SLAC Human Resources. \n6. Income during Family and Medical Leaves\na. Use of Accrued Time\nAccrued time consists of sick time, PTO for the calendar year, floating holiday for the calendar year and vacation, to be used in that order. During medical leaves (including Workers' Compensation, FMLA, CFRA and PDL), the university will use an employee's accrued time to maintain the employee's base pay. For Paid Family Leaves (PFL), please see section 6.d. When the employee is also receiving disability benefits, DLS ensures that combined income from both the disability vendor and the University does not exceed pre-disability pay. Accrued time is used until the employee goes off disability, including Worker's Compensation, or until all balances are exhausted. The use of some forms of accrued time is at the employee's option during certain FMLA/CFRA leaves. If an employee chooses not to use accrued time during a medical leave, the employee must notify DLS by email within 24-48 hours of their claim being approved. An employee's request to opt out of the payment practice can only be for future pay cycles and not retroactively. Disability and Leave Services (DLS) administers the employee's records in the Human Resources Management System (HRMS). Procedures at SLAC will differ.\nThus, if the employee has accrued time and is also receiving disability benefits, the employee will receive disability checks from the disability administrator and/or the Worker's Compensation administrator and reduced paychecks from the university until their accrued time has been exhausted. Once the accrued time is exhausted, the employee will only receive disability checks from the disability vendor for the duration of the approved leave.\nb. Overpayment\nIf an employee has been overpaid, the employee must reimburse the university for the overpayment either by direct payment or through payroll deduction.\nc. Voluntary Disability Insurance / Short-Term Disability\n(1) Introduction\nThe university's VDI plan is state-approved to take the place of SDI by providing benefits that are better than those of the state's plan. The VDI plan provides partial income continuation for periods of disability of up to 52 weeks or a maximum dollar amount. This plan is described in the Statement of Coverage available on the Cardinal at Work website. For information on SDI, go to the Employment Development Department's website at www.edd.ca.gov.\n(2) Eligibility\nFaculty and staff based in California are covered for short-term disabilities by either the university's Voluntary Disability Insurance plan (VDI) or State Disability Insurance (SDI) if the employee opted out of VDI. Non-California employees are covered under a separate 13-week short-term disability plan (STD).\n(3) Benefit Waiting Period\nRefer to the Voluntary Disability Insurance Statement of Coverage on the Cardinal at Work website.\n(4) Taxability\nShort-term disability (VDI/SDI) payments are non-taxable benefits. These non-taxable benefits are paid directly to the employee by the disability administrator.\nd. Paid Family Leave (PFL)\n(1) Introduction\nThis California state program provides partial income replacement during absences from work to care for seriously ill family members (parent, child, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or parent-in-law) or to bond with a new child. It is not a separate type of leave.\n(2) Eligibility\nFaculty and staff based in California contribute to a Paid Family Leave (PFL) insurance benefit according to state law as part of the VDI deduction.\n(3) Supplementing PFL Payments\nDuring PFL, eligible employees will receive a portion of their base pay, up to a weekly maximum, from the disability administrator or state disability program, for up to eight weeks in a rolling 12-month period. The university will supplement the approved state paid family leave benefit to maintain the eligible employee’s base pay for the first six weeks that the employee is receiving PFL benefits. For the additional two weeks that the employee is eligible for PFL benefits, they may elect to use sick, vacation, floating holiday or PTO time, combined with the approved state leave, to maintain their base pay. Together, the state PFL and the university’s supplement will not exceed 100% of an employee’s base pay as of their last day worked before starting their leave. \nDisability and Leave Services (DLS) within University Human Resources administers the employee's records in the Human Resources Management System (HRMS). DLS ensures that combined income from both the disability vendor and the university does not exceed pre-disability pay. Procedures at SLAC will differ.\n(4) Overpayment\nIf an employee has been overpaid, the employee must reimburse the university for the overpayment either by direct payment or through payroll deduction. Failure to repay an overpayment could result in disciplinary action.\n(5) Taxability\nPFL is a non-taxable benefit for state and FICA, but is a taxable benefit for Federal tax purposes.\n(6) More Information\nThe benefit is described on the Cardinal at Work website. Forms are available on this website in the Resource Library.\ne. Long-Term Disability (LTD)\n(1) Introduction\nThis plan provides partial income continuation during longer periods of disability. LTD benefits could start after a disability period of 90 consecutive days. After a disability period of 15 months, the plan's benefits are more restricted because a more stringent definition of \"disability\" is used.\n(2) Eligibility\nEmployees whose approved disability continues past 90 consecutive days may be eligible for Long-Term Disability. The disability vendor provides the employee with the appropriate information when the employee's disability period approaches 90 days.\nEligible employees based outside of California in a state that offers paid family leave must apply for paid family benefits through their state.\nEligible employees based outside of California in a state that does not offer paid family leave benefits can file a paid family claim through Stanford's disability vendor.\n(3) Taxability\nLong-term disability benefits are taxable for federal and state, non-taxable for FICA.\n(4) More Information\nThe Summary Plan Description for the Long-Term Disability Plan provides information about coverage, definition of disability, and benefits. It is available on the Cardinal at Work website.\n7. Benefits During Disability Periods\na. Health and Life Benefits\n(1) Paid Leave\nEmployees on paid FMLA/CFRA, PFL, VDI or Workers' Compensation will have their applicable benefit contributions deducted from their reduced paychecks. See (3) for LTD.\n(2) Unpaid Leave\nEmployees on unpaid PFL, VDI, Workers' Compensation, and all LTD participants (paid or unpaid) will have the same university benefit contributions as when actively employed. The employee will be billed for the employee portion of the costs on an after-tax basis.\n(3) LTD and Part-Time Work\nIf an employee continues to receive LTD benefits, but is able to work part-time, there will be no change in benefit contributions. Employees will have applicable benefit contributions deducted from their reduced paychecks.\nb. Retirement Savings Plan (SCRP)\n(1) Paid Leave\nWhen an employee continues to receive pay from the university, retirement savings plan benefit accruals and/or contributions continue, subject to plan provisions.\n(2) LTD Plus Paid Leave\nEmployees who supplement LTD benefits with accrued time (e.g., sick, vacation, PTO, floating holiday) will have that paid time counted as earnings for university retirement savings plans, subject to plan provisions.\nc. Retiree Medical Eligibility\nDuring the first 90 days on Short-Term Disability or Workers' Compensation, time is counted toward official retiree medical eligibility. After 90 days on LTD, the time does not count toward official retiree medical eligibility.\nd. Benefits in Cases of Termination\n(1) Medical and Dental Coverage\nA regular employee whose university employment is terminated while the employee is receiving benefit payments from a Short-Term Disability plan or Workers' Compensation plan may continue medical and dental coverages at their own expense through COBRA for 18 months, or until LTD is approved. If LTD is approved, they may contact Stanford Benefits, for information on their eligibility for medical and life insurance plans.\n(2) Life Insurance\nLife insurance portability or conversion to an individual plan is available. The employee should contact Stanford Benefits at the time of termination for the appropriate forms.\n8. For More Information\nConsult with your local Human Resources Office or review the Cardinal at Work website. General questions about State Disability Insurance (SDI) and Workers' Compensation should be referred to the appropriate government office."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/university-funds","text":"3.1.2 University Funds | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.1\nThis Guide Memo describes the University's funds and budgets.\n1. Fiduciary Responsibility for Fund Balances\nIndividual fund balances are controlled by the fund owner. This may be a faculty member or principal investigator, a department head, a university officer, or the university as a whole. The owner of the fund has the fiduciary responsibility for prudent management of fund balances. While at any time during the fiscal year a fund may go into deficit, by the end of the fiscal year, any fund with a deficit equal to or in excess of $1,000 in cash must be made whole by some other appropriate funding source. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the University Budget Office and the Office of the University’s Chief Financial Officer.\n2. Basis of Accounting\na. Fund Accounting\nThe University maintains its accounts in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. Because the University receives funding from a variety of sources, with different types of terms and restrictions, each source must be tracked as a separate accounting entity in a unique fund.\nb. Restrictions on Use of Funds\nFund restrictions are classified differently for internal and external reporting purposes. While some of the terms overlap, they have different meanings depending on the reporting context. For external reporting purposes, the definitions are based on generally accepted accounting principles. For internal reporting purposes, the definitions are based on the use of the funds.\n(1) Internal Reporting Definitions\nRestricted: When a donor makes a gift to the University, the donor may provide terms for the use of that gift. If the terms specify a particular purpose, the funds are restricted to that purpose. Income and appreciation produced by restricted endowments is also restricted as per the terms of the endowment. Funding provided by sponsored agencies or corporations for specific grant or contract work is also considered restricted.\nUnrestricted: Funds without donor terms or with terms that allow the funds to be used anywhere at the University. If donor terms allow a gift to be used broadly within a school or unit, it is deemed Unrestricted at the unit level, but Restricted by central University administration.\nDesignated: These are unrestricted funds that have been designated for a specific purpose by the Board of Trustees or senior management. Internal units in the University can designate unrestricted resources to any number of specific purposes, but from a broader analytical perspective those funds are unrestricted for purposes of internal reporting.\n(2) External Reporting Definitions\nPermanently Restricted: The University classifies as Permanently Restricted (a) the original value of gifts donated to the Endowment and (b) accumulations to the Endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument.\nTemporarily Restricted: Temporarily Restricted assets include gifts and pledges that are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that expire with the passage of time, payment of pledges, or specific actions to be undertaken by the University or the Hospitals; these assets are then released and reclassified as Unrestricted. In addition, appreciation and income on certain donor-restricted endowments funds are classified as Temporarily Restricted until authorized for spending. Donor-restricted resources intended for capital projects are initially recorded as Temporarily Restricted and released from their temporary restrictions and reclassified as Unrestricted when the asset is placed in service. Also included in this category is the University’s net equity in split interest agreements, expendable at maturity.\nUnrestricted: Funds that are not Permanently Restricted or Temporarily Restricted are treated as Unrestricted for external reporting purposes. This includes expendable gifts that have donor restrictions, so long as the University is free to spend the gift. Funds Functioning as Endowment, or FFE, are University resources designated by the Board or internal University units to be held as endowment. FFE is usually considered Unrestricted per accounting rules, as are most other expendable resources in the University.\nc. Chart of Accounts\nStanford’s accounting system uses an alphanumeric code, or chart of accounts. The fund number, also referred to as the award number, is included in the chart of accounts. The University accounting system also records attributes assigned to each fund that further define the fund purpose and restrictions. For a detailed explanation of its structure, please see Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. \nThe Controller's Office, a unit in Financial Management Services (FMS), and the departments and individuals authorized to spend funds in an account share responsibility for using the chart of accounts appropriately. The Controller's Office is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the chart of accounts and for assigning fund and other account numbers. Schools and departments are responsible for communicating any restrictions on use of funds so that Controller's Office staff can set up the account correctly. Find information on the various kinds of expenditure accounts in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTAs).\n3. Fund Groups\nThe University combines funds with similar characteristics into fund groups for budgeting, planning, and reporting purposes.\na. Expendable Resources\nExpendable resources are available for the current operation of the University; balances can be accumulated for future expenditure. Sources of funds include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(1) Contracts and Grants\nFunds provided by sponsors to reimburse the direct costs of contracts and grants are restricted per internal reporting definitions. The terms of the award and applicable regulations determine how the money may be spent. To apply for a contract or grant the principal investigator for the project submits a proposal through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or its delegate to the sponsor. OSR negotiates the award with the sponsor. For more information, see the OSR website.\n(2) Tuition and Fees\nThe Board of Trustees sets tuition and fee rates. The Student Financial Services Office collects tuition and fee payments from registered students each quarter. Income from tuition and fees is unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\n(3) Gifts\nDonor gifts that are not ultimately directed to the endowment are usually considered expendable; exceptions include cases where the funds are not available for the current operation of the University, such as Pending funds and Donor Advised Funds. Donors typically specify the purpose of gifts, which will determine whether the gifts are assigned to expendable, capital, or endowed purposes. The Office of Development solicits and processes gifts to the University. For more information, see Chapter 4: Giving to Stanford.\n(4) Reimbursement of Facilities and Administrative Costs (Indirect Costs)\nThe Cost and Management Analysis Office calculates rates that are charged to each contract and grant to pay for facilities and administrative overhead costs associated with sponsored research. These costs include utilities, building maintenance, and administrative support. The responsible agency for the federal government, which for Stanford is the Office of Naval Research (ONR), approves the rates. Indirect cost reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions. Information on rate calculations and policy is available on the DoResearch website. \n(5) Reimbursement of Facilities Costs (Infrastructure and Utilities Charges)\nDesignated Funds and Restricted Funds that do not otherwise pay facilities-related costs (both Sponsored and Non-sponsored) are charged an infrastructure fee to offset operations, maintenance, and utilities costs paid by University unrestricted funds. The fee is a percentage of certain types of expenditures, and these reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions. More information is available in Guide Memo 3.3.1: Infrastructure Charges.\n(6) Auxiliary Activities\nAuxiliaries are self-contained financial entities (see Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTAs)). Income is used to support operations, including overhead, and all income is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\n(7) Special Program Fees & Other Income\nIncome from outside sources related to programs, patents and royalties, program activities, affiliations, ticket income and the like are collected throughout the institution. Much of this income is subject to the Infrastructure and Utilities Charge. All of it is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\nb. Endowment Funds\nFunds in the Endowment include:\n(1) True Endowment:\nEndowment funds created pursuant to the terms of a donor’s gift. These funds are generally intended to last in perpetuity. Funds established with gifts directed to the endowment are typically used to purchase “pure” shares in the Merged Pool, and in rare circumstances are held in assets specifically directed by the donor. True Endowment and payout from True Endowment are considered restricted per internal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose.\nThe Board of Trustees establishes an annual payout rate for distributions from the University’s endowment funds. Payout may be made from True Endowment without limitation to income as long as the payout rate is prudently established and the gift terms do not provide otherwise. There is a group of funds referred to as “Pool A” funds that are established by gifts with terms that specify something like the following: “income but no appreciation” may be paid out of the fund. These types of funds are typically no longer established by the University. There are also funds that contain what are known as “Pool B Limited” shares. This situation arises where the donor specifies something like the following: only income and appreciation above the original gift value may be paid out. These types of funds are also typically no longer established by the University. Funds without such terms of limitation are referred to in the University accounting system as “Unlimited.\"Payout generated by a true endowment fund that cannot be used for operational purposes can be redirected back to the principal of the fund for investment if provided for in the donor's gift agreement, or at the request of an internal University unit. When the funds are reinvested pursuant to a provision in the donor’s gift agreement, they add “pure” shares to the Endowment; when they are reinvested at the request of an internal unit they add “quasi” shares to the Endowment. In both cases, reinvestment takes place at year end unless the provision in the donor's gift agreement specifically provides that all payout be reinvested until the True Endowment fund reaches a certain level, in which case reinvestment is made monthly. All such reinvestment is subject to the same donor terms as the original Endowment gift, and is restricted per internal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose. Any reinvestment of unused payout by an internal University unit must be requested by July 31 for the given fiscal year.For True Endowment funds that contain Pool B Limited shares, payout is limited to income and appreciation in any year. Withdrawals in excess of income and appreciation are only permitted if that fund also contains quasi shares, in which case up to the full value of all quasi shares can be sold to make the full regular payout for that year (or as much of the full regular payout as possible). Requests for such withdrawals must be made by July 31 for the given fiscal year; refer to the form Withdrawal Guidelines for True Endowment.\n(2) Funds Functioning as Endowment (or Quasi-Endowment Funds):\nFunds Functioning as Endowment (FFE) are expendable resources (both restricted and unrestricted per internal reporting definitions) that are invested in the Merged Pool (MP) and are considered part of the University’s Endowment. These are created at the request of an internal University unit (department, school, etc.). In order to create a new FFE, the unit must invest a minimum of $1 million. The minimum addition of “new” money to an existing FFE is $250,000. The University’s Chief Financial Officer and Provost are jointly authorized to make an exception to these minimums. Requests to create FFE must be approved by both the Dean or Chair, and the school’s or unit’s Senior Financial Officer. Requests to approve the creation of FFE involving gift funding must be reviewed by the Office of Planned Giving.\nTo optimize investment returns, the University takes a long term perspective of its investments in the MP which requires minimal unplanned cash flow volatility in the portfolio. Thus, the MP should not be used by individual fundholders to support short term needs. Accordingly, FFE invested in the MP these funds are subject to the following guidelines:\nLock-up Periods:\nAny FFE investment made on or after September 1, 2016, is subject to a 7-year initial “lock-up” period, during which it cannot be redeemed.\nAny FFE investment made prior to September 1, 2016 is subject to the previous 5-year initial “lock-up” period, during which it cannot be redeemed.\nAnnual Withdrawal Limits:\nOnce the “lock-up” period is met, FFE can be withdrawn under the following conditions:\nFFE invested on or after September 1, 2016 are subject to an annual withdrawal limit, which is the greater of: \n$5 million, or\n10% of an individual fund’s market value. The 10% limit will be calculated as 10% of the fund’s market value which is eligible for withdrawal at the time the request is made, less any amount that has been redeemed or is pending redemption during the same fiscal year.\nFFE invested prior to September 1, 2016 are governed by the previous FFE policy, and are not subject to an annual withdrawal limit.\nRequired Approvals:\nWithdrawals are also subject to the following approval authority:\nWithdrawals in keeping with these guidelines may be transferred out of the endowment with the approval of the school financial officer, the University Chief Financial Officer and the Provost. Smaller amounts may be withdrawn only if the remaining balance is being withdrawn.\nWithdrawals outside these guidelines are not typically allowed and extraordinary exceptions require an action of the Board of Trustees.\nNotification Periods:\nIn order to provide the Stanford Management Company with sufficient time to divest assets, requests for withdrawals must be received by Fund Accounting based on the following minimum notification requirements prior to anticipated month of withdrawal:\nUp to $150 million – 90 days\n$150 million-$250 million – 150 days\nGreater than $250 million – 270 days\nPlease refer to the \"Investment and Withdrawal Guidelines for Funds Functioning as Endowment Greater than $500,000\" form for further details.\nReinvestment of Payout:\nEven if the amount is less than the minimum for new principal investments, at the request of the creating unit, all unused payout from FFE may automatically be reinvested back in to the principal of the fund at year end; this election can only be made upon the formation of the fund or when additions of $500,000 or more are made to the fund. If a unit chooses not to request the automatic year end reinvestment, they may contact Fund Accounting by July 31 to specify the amount that should be reinvested for the given fiscal year.\n(3) Term Endowments:\nEndowment created at the request of a donor, but intended to be fully spent down on a timeline established by the donor. These monies are used to purchase “quasi” shares in the Endowment. Regular withdrawals are made as per the donor terms.\nc. Non-Endowment Funds invested in the Merged Pool\nFunds in this group include, but are not limited to:\n(1) Life Income Gifts:\nA life income gift allows donors to give assets to Stanford while providing themselves or others with income for a period of time before Stanford is permitted to use the gift; until that period has ended, the gift is not counted as part of the University Endowment. The university, as trustee, manages the investment of the assets and pays a specified income to the donor, the donor’s designated beneficiaries, or both. Income payments continue for the beneficiaries' lives or, in some cases, for a term of up to 20 years.\n(2) Donor Advised Funds:\nStanford has Donor Advised Funds. For more information on the size and type of gifts required to create a Donor Advised Fund at Stanford, and the amount of the fund that must ultimately be designated for the use of the University, please refer to the Office of Development’s website. In cases where all or part of a Donor Advised Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it is not counted as part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund for use per the terms of the donor’s request.\n(3) Pending Funds:\nThese are gifts where the purpose is pending final designation by the donor and the university. In cases where all or part of a Pending Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it is not counted as part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund for use per the terms of the donor’s request.\nd. Student Loan Funds\nStudent Loan Funds are not meant to be expensed, but rather are loaned to students as a portion of the financial aid package. As these loans are repaid, the principal and accumulated interest become available for new student loans.\ne. Plant Funds\nPlant Funds are funds that have been received or designated by the Trustees for facilities and retirement of indebtedness. They also include all of the University's investments in long-lived capital assets and related liabilities.\nf. Agency Funds\nThese are funds held for others, with Stanford acting as the custodian. Funds in this group represent liabilities owed by the University.\n4. Intermediate Pool Funds\nIntermediate Pool Mechanics\nThe Intermediate Pool (IP) functions as a unitized pool with shares and share prices, similar to the Merged Pool. The net return of the portfolio, less the cost to administer the portfolio, is allocated to the individual participating funds. Returns are not distributed on a scheduled basis, but are reinvested and accumulated in the participating funds.\nShareholder Policies\nThe Intermediate Pool is open to the following types of shareholders:\nNew Pending Funds not intended for endowment\nNew Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), or portions of DAFs, not intended for Stanford’s endowment\nNew additions to the Land Development Fund\nHospital investments\nSchool and Department Funds (SDF) (e.g. The Stanford Business School Trust, Stanford Engineering Venture Fund, DAPER Investment Fund, etc.)\nIntermediate term reserves from school and units\nA portion of the Expendable Funds Pool (EFP), at the discretion of the University’s Chief Financial Officer\nDebt recycling pool and unexpended debt proceeds\nOther centrally managed funds, at the discretion of the University’s Chief Financial Officer\nRequests to invest school and unit reserves in the IP made by a school or academic department must be approved by both the Dean or Chair, and the school’s Senior Financial Officer.\nRequests from an auxiliary must be approved by a University Vice Provost or Vice President. \nRequests from an administrative unit must be approved by the Provost.\nMinimum Investment Amounts and Lock-up Periods\nPending Funds invested in the IP require an initial investment amount of at least $500,000. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Vice President for Development. \nAll other investments in the IP, including both initial investment and additions, must be in increments of at least $1 million. Exceptions must be approved by the University’s Chief Financial Officer.\nSchool and unit reserves invested in the IP are subject to a four year lock-up period, during which the school or unit may not withdraw from the fund.\nSMC’s Intermediate Pool Investment Policy Guidelines\nSMC manages the investment policy of the IP with the intention of replicating the debt and equity exposure of a well-balanced global investment portfolio, investing in passive index funds.\n5. Budgeting\nEach year the University prepares a consolidated budget based on estimates of income and expenses. Budgeting enables the University to verify fund availability when processing expenditures.\na. Responsibilities \nThe Provost is the University's chief academic officer and chief budget officer. The development of the University's Consolidated Budget is a principal responsibility of this officer.\nThe Vice Provost for Budget and Auxiliaries Management directs and manages, on behalf of the Provost, the process leading to the development of the Consolidated Budget.\nBudget Officers in schools and departments coordinate all budget activities within their respective organizations in collaboration with the University Budget Office in the Provost's Office and the Controller's Office.\nThe University Budget Office in the Provost's Office maintains the budget system, approves the budget submissions of all schools and departments, and monitors and reports on variances from the approved budget.\nb. Annual Budget Process/Cycle\nThe budget process is directed by the University Budget Office.\n(1) Forecasts\nIn the spring, budget officers prepare high-level income and expense forecasts for the following year. The University Budget Office uses these forecasts to prepare the University consolidated budget forecast that they present, via the Stanford University Budget Plan, to the Board of Trustees for approval.\n(2) Consolidated Budget\nFollowing the approval of the Stanford University Budget Plan (Consolidated Forecast) by the Board of Trustees, budget officers record the final, detailed, account-by-account budget for both revenues and expenses (salary and non-salary) in the budgeting system. As of September 1, it is the official University Consolidated Budget.\n(3) Variance Reporting\nPeriodically through the year, as determined by University management, budget officers provide analysis and explanation of the variance between actual income and expense (or projected income and expense) and the Consolidated Budget in accordance with the guidelines provided by the University Budget Office. As necessary, analysis and explanation of changes from the previous fiscal year to the current fiscal year are also provided by the budget units. The University Budget Office uses this information to prepare high-level variance analysis for the Board of Trustees and University management.\n6. Fund Transfers\nFund transfers are accounting entries that move all, or a portion of, a fund's balance to another fund. The appropriateness of a fund transfer is dependent on the characteristics of the source and destination funds, including the type of fund, the restrictions of the fund, whether the source and destination fund share the same infrastructure and EFP (Expendable Funds Pool) treatment, etc. Generally, fund transfers are allowed when the characteristics of the source and destination funds conform to one another and the terms of each fund does not preclude such a transfer. These transfers are used to:\nMove money between designated funds or between restricted funds (generally transfers between a restricted fund and a designated fund are not allowed, nor are transfers to/from a sponsored project fund)\nTransfer money into or between plant funds\nAllocate and reallocate general (unrestricted) funds among budget units\nIncrease or decrease restricted funds’ support of an Operating Budget account\nAuthorized central office staff typically performs fund transfers.\nAs transfer of funding creates an initial disconnect between where the funds were collected and where they were used (appropriated), strong controls and audit trails of fund transfers are required by the University and is responsible business practice."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/cost-policy","text":"3.1.4 Cost Policy | Administrative Guide\nSkip to main content Skip to secondary navigation \nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJuly 26, 2022 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.5\nThis Guide Memo outlines general policies on expense reimbursement by the federal government and discusses the importance of assigning the correct Project, Task and Award (PTA) and Expenditure Type to expenses and credits. For more detailed information, see Purpose and Use of Expenditure Type Codes on the Gateway to Financial Activities website. \n1. Background\nAbout a quarter of all funding for University expenditures comes from the federal government. Most of this funding comes in the form of direct support for sponsored projects, but a substantial portion comes in the form of reimbursement for indirect costs of federally sponsored grants and contracts. Stanford tracks whether University activities are allowable for reimbursement using the Project, Task and Award (PTA) to which transactions are charged, and tracks allowable and unallowable cost objects through the Expenditure Type used to record transactions.\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted financial approval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information, see Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford’s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n2. Definitions\nDirect Costs are expenses that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project or other direct cost objective, such as Auxiliary Activities or Instruction, or expenses that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.\nExample: cost of materials used on a project\nIndirect Costs are those incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily with a particular sponsored project. Indirect costs are sometimes called Facility & Administrative (F&A) or overhead costs.\nExample: costs of buildings or utilities\n3. General Rules\nRules for allowability are covered in the government document OMB Circular A-21 and the Uniform Guidance. In many cases, the issue of whether a particular cost is allowable is a complex one. When in doubt, consult with your local financial or research administrator, the Office of Sponsored Research or Research Financial Compliance and Services (RFCS). All unallowable activities and objects (line items) must be coded as such. In general, expenses are chargeable to the federal government only if they are:\nReasonable: A prudent person would have purchased this item and paid this price.\nAllocable: Expenses can be allocated to the government activity based on benefit derived, cause and effect, or other equitable relationship.\nConsistently Treated: Like expenses must be treated the same in like circumstances.\nAllowable: Allowable for reimbursement as specified by government regulations.\nIf an expense cannot meet the above criteria, it is not eligible to be charged to a federal grant or contract no matter what its purpose.\nNote: Agencies that sponsor grants and contracts use the term allowable to mean permitted as a direct cost under the terms of a specific grant or contract. Expenses that are generally allowable for federal reimbursement may not necessarily be permitted under the terms of a specific grant or contract.\n4. Unallowable Costs\nExpenses that are unallowable for federal reimbursement as a direct or indirect cost may still be reasonable and necessary business expenses permitted by the University, as outlined in the Administrative Guide. Departments may incur these expenses, but they must be coded as unallowable so they can be readily identified and excluded from the indirect cost calculation. A detailed list of specifically unallowable activities (Tasks) and objects (Expenditure Types) is provided in theUnderstanding Cost Policy course."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/charitable-donations-stanford-university-other","text":"3.1.6 Charitable Donations by Stanford University to Other Charitable Organizations\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nDecember 06, 2021 \nEffective Date\nDecember 05, 2014 \nPrint\nThis memo describes the limited circumstances when a charitable donation may be made by Stanford to an outside organization.\n1. Policy Statement\nStanford University is a non-profit public charity that receives its funds from sponsors, donors, parents/students and others in furtherance of our educational, research and patient care missions. Accordingly, provision of University funds to other US charitable institutions as donations is highly restricted. When considering support of another charitable organization, Stanford personnel must first consider whether the objective should be achieved through a contractual arrangement or other form of written understanding with the potential recipient institution, spelling out services and deliverables that align with Stanford’s purposes. Coordinate with the Office of Community Engagement to assess potential collaboration opportunities, as needed.\nAll approved donations from Stanford are limited to US charities with current Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(c)(3) status. No donor funds or sponsor-restricted funds may be used in support of other charitable organizations. \n2. When Donations to Other Charitable Organizations Are Permissible\nA donation may only be made at the direction of the President, the Provost, the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer, or the Chief External Relations Officer.\nA donation may be made to the charity of the family’s choice in the case of the death of an employee or a member of their immediate family, in lieu of customary flowers (Limit: $100).\nUpon recommendation by a donor, a donation may be made from the portion of their donor-advised fund available for such designation. Recipient charities must be vetted and approved by senior management of the Office of Development.\n3. Exceptions to Policy\nExceptions to the policy are rare. The Office of Community Engagement (OCE) and the Office of Government Affairs (OGA), under the direction of the Chief External Relations Officer and in close coordination with related offices, will respond to inquiries about exceptions and guide the university’s response to external community requests. \nFollowing review, requests for exception must be approved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer or the Chief External Relations Officer. Requests should state:\nHow and over what period Stanford-provided funds would be spent by the intended recipient.\nWhat Stanford goals would be achieved by the donation.\nWhy such goals could not be achieved through any other form of relationship with the charity.\nThat the recipient will provide written acknowledgement of the funding, certify that the funds were used for Stanford’s intended purpose and detail what results were achieved.\nA description of the intended recipient charity and proof of its tax-exempt status.\nThe Offices of the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer and the Chief External Relations Officer will annually create a list of such donations for each fiscal year, including the name, address, Federal Employer Identification Number and Section of the Internal Revenue Code under which the organization is granted tax-exemption (typically IRC Section 501 (c)(3)), and the amount of cash or extent of property being donated for any recipient of more than $5,000 from the university within that year. A copy of this list is to be forwarded to the Tax Department within Financial Management Services to include this information on Stanford’s annual Form 990 filing with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)."}

The GA subledger records all detailed expenditure transactions and then summarizes them in the GL. The GA module has five segments: Project (P), Task (T), Award (A), Expenditure types (E) and Organization. A Project (P) is an activity or event with a single purpose. A Task (T) is a further breakdown of the project; every project has at least one task. An Award (A) is a funding source for a particular project or task. Find further information on the University's Chart of Accounts at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. This Guide Memo describes the various kinds of expenditure accounts or PTAs (the intersection of Project, Task, and Award) within the University's accounting system.\n1. Operating Budget PTA\na. Purpose\nOperating Budget PTAs are the primary PTAs for the University's core academic programs and support services. Operating Budget PTAs are used to record accounting transactions for these core activities.\nb. Source of Funds\nAt the beginning of the fiscal year, Operating Budget PTAs receive money only from University unrestricted funds and from appropriate departmental designated funds, gift funds, and endowment income funds (see Guide Memo 3.1.2: University Funds). Changes in funding during the year may be made online by authorized budget officers.\nc. Setting Up\nThe Fund Accounting department of the Controller's Office sets up and maintains PTAs funded from the University's Operating Budget. To request a new Operating Budget P, T, and/or A, a person who has organizational authority submits the Fund Accounting PTA Request form via email to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office. The form is located at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA. \nd. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end (August 31), all unused restricted funds that are held in an Operating Budget Award must be returned to their original source fund. If expenditures have exceeded the Expense Control, other sources of funding must be identified to cover the deficit. If there are still budgeted funds available, work with the University's Budget Office to determine how to handle these funds.\ne. Closing an Operating Budget PTA\nAt any time, a department may send a memo to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office requesting that an Operating Budget P, T, and/or A be closed to expense. The P, T, and/or A will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n2. Grant and Contract PTA\na. Purpose\nA grant or contract fund and related expenditure PTA(s) are used to record accounting transactions for a sponsored project. The Research Policy Handbook 13.1, sets out criteria for determining if external support for a project should be handled as a sponsored project. Note that external support that does not meet these criteria is handled as a gift.\nb. Source of Funds\nA grant or contract fund receives money from the agency sponsoring the research, instruction, or other sponsored activity at the University. Proposals for grants and contracts are processed through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or its delegates. Additional information is available at the DoResearch website. \nc. Setting Up\nWhen a grant or contract has been awarded, OSR assigns a fund (award) number for the sponsored project, and sets up related Project(s) and Task(s) as requested. OSR handles any subsequent accounting system maintenance during the life of the award. OSR also receives awards for student aid directly from a school or from the Graduate Financial Aids Office. The form used to request a PTA is located here. \nd. Early Accounts\nFor the effective and economical conduct of a sponsored project, it is sometimes necessary for costs to be incurred before the award document has been received. In such cases, departments should request that OSR set up an early PTA. The \"Authorization for Early Project Task and Award Request\" form is available online here.The early PTA becomes the permanent PTA when the award is effective; no cost transfers are needed. Pre-award costs must be charged to a pre-award account and may not be placed on an unrelated award and later transferred to the benefiting PTA.\ne. Ongoing PTA Management\n(1) Allowability of Expenditures\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) is accountable for the accuracy, allowability, allocability, appropriateness and timely review of charges to a grant or contract PTA (or a related cost sharing PTA) and for ensuring that expenditures do not exceed the level authorized by the award. See Guide Memos:\n3.1.4: Cost Policy\n3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures\n3.2.2: Cost Transfers\n3.2.3: Allocations and Offsets\n(2) Approvals\nThe terms of the award and governing cost principles may require approval from the agency for such actions as rebudgeting funds, travel, or purchasing capital equipment. OSR processes approval requests.\n(3) Review\nThe PI or someone else knowledgeable about the sponsored project must review the PTA each month, bringing any questionable items to the PI for decision on any needed action. Review guidance and tools are available at DoResearch. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure report.\n(4) Suballocations\nA suballocation of a grant or contract may be set up to handle accounting for:\nA subcontract\nSeparate portions of the work\nFabrication of capital equipment\nA conference associated with the project: This is usually accomplished by setting up additional Tasks within the Project, linked to the appropriate award(s).\nf. Fiscal Year End\nAccounting records for grant and contract PTAs are closed for reporting purposes at fiscal year end. The entire budget and all expenditures for the period of the award are carried forward to the new fiscal year expenditure reports.\ng. Closing a Grant or Contract PTA\n(1) Definition\nCloseout is the administrative process whereby sponsors determine whether all technical and administrative requirements of the grant or contract have been completed. Sponsored projects are considered completed or \"closed out\" only after the sponsor receives and approves all technical, financial, invention and property reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award and notifies Stanford of its acceptance and signoff.\n(2) Principal Investigator's Responsibilities\nAt the close of a grant or contract, the Principal Investigator is accountable for ensuring that the expenses recorded are complete, allowable, allocable, and without overdrafts. For more information, see Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.8 Cost Transfer Policy for Sponsored Projects.\n(3) Office of Sponsored Research Responsibilities\nOSR prepares the final financial reports and performs a review. Generally, the final financial report is due 90 days after the end of the award.\n3. Cost-Sharing PTA\na. Purpose\nCost sharing represents that portion of the total project costs of a sponsored agreement borne by the University, rather than the sponsor. The Research Policy Handbook 15.3 states the University's policy on cost sharing. Separate PTAs must be established to track committed cost sharing. This is usually accomplished by setting up a cost sharing Task in the Project that holds the sponsored project, and linking it to a cost-sharing award.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe Principal Investigator must identify and provide resources to fund the cost-sharing PTA. Funds from other federal awards may not be used as the source of cost sharing except as authorized by statute. Funds generally come from unrestricted, gift, endowment income, or designated funds.\nc. Setting Up\nThe notice of award prepared by OSR and the signed award document indicate if the project involves cost sharing. OSR will not open the sponsored PTA until the related cost-sharing PTA is opened. When a cost-sharing PTA is required, a person with signature authority over the fund from which the cost-sharing PTA will be funded or guaranteed sends a copy of the cost-sharing budget and the Cost-Sharing Authorization form to OSR requesting the PTA be opened. For information on how to set up a sponsored PTA, see the DoResearch website.\nd. Ongoing PTA Management\nCost-sharing PTAs are subject to the same PTA management procedures as described above for grant and contract PTAs.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nCost-sharing PTAs must be fully funded at the end of the University's fiscal year. Cost-sharing budgets and expenditures carry over to the new fiscal year, as described above for grant and contract PTAs.\nf. Closing a Cost Sharing PTA\nThe cost-sharing PTA is closed at the same time as the related grant or contract account, as described above.\n4. Gift PTA\na. Purpose\nA gift PTA is used to record the expenditures that execute the purpose of the gift.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe source of money for a gift fund may be a single gift or multiple gifts that have a common purpose and any related income generated by the gift itself or its associated endowment.\nc. Setting Up\nWhen a gift is received whose terms require the opening of a separate fund, the Department submits the Fund Accounting PTA Request form via email to their school/department Fund Accountant in the Controller's Office. They must also fax copies of the donor documentation and a Gift Transmittal Form to their fund accountant. The original donor correspondence regarding the restricted purpose of the gift and the original Gift Transmittal along with the donor check should be sent to Gift Processing. Never hold a donor check while waiting for a PTA. Fund Accounting, in consultation with the school, assigns a fund/award number and sets up the related expenditure Project and Task(s). Fund Accounting creates the Fund Authorization document that describes the purpose of the fund. If the gift creates a new endowment fund, Fund Accounting sets up a related expendable endowment income fund to receive the endowment income. The form used to request a new Gift PTA is located at here.\nFor step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA .\nd. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the balance of the gift fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expenditures exceed available funds in an expendable gift fund or an endowment income fund, a transfer from another appropriate fund restricted to departmental use must cover the overdraft. Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriate account to use.\ne. Closing a Gift PTA\n(1) Endowment\nEndowment gift funds and their related endowment income funds are very seldom closed. In the event that a PTA funded by an endowment income fund needs to be closed, the department should contact Fund Accounting. The account will be closed the first of the next month.\n(2) Expendable Gift PTAs\nAt any time during the year, departments may send a memo to Fund Accounting requesting that a PTA for an expendable gift fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n5. Designated Funds and Related PTA\na. Purpose\nDesignated funds generally contain unrestricted funds that the University (rather than a donor or sponsoring agency) has decided to use for a specific purpose.\nb. Source of Funds\nThere are two sorts of designated funds:(1) General funds that have been transferred to a department for a specific purpose, such as departmental research support.(2) Income that has been generated by the department and designated for departmental use. Examples are fees from professional services and conferences.\nc. Setting Up\nTo open a designated fund and related expenditure account, the department sends an email and Fund Accounting PTA Request Form to their school/department Fund Accounting. The form used to request a new PTA is located here. Fund Accounting, in consultation with the school, assigns a fund (award) number and sets up the related Project and Task(s) with the Fund Authorization information. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA.\nd. Changes to Fund Balances\nDesignated funds funded by general funds transfers are increased only by transfers from other University designated or unrestricted funds. That is, income cannot be deposited to this kind of fund.\nDesignated funds holding income are increased as cash receipts are deposited or transferred from other University designated or unrestricted funds.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the balance of the designated fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expenditures exceed available funds in a designated fund, a transfer from another appropriate fund must cover the overdraft. Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriate account to use.\nf. Closing a Designated Fund PTA\nAt any time during the year, the department may send an email to Fund Accounting requesting that a P, T, and/or A for a designated fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n6. Capital Asset Projects\na. Purpose\nCapital Asset projects capture expenditures related to facilities and infrastructure projects or computer hardware or software systems that require capitalization. They allow the University to categorize expenditures as capital assets or expenses and to collect expenditures in a way that supports indirect cost recovery, service center rate development and financial reporting.\nb. Source of Funds\nMultiple sources of funding may support a specific capital project. Examples are gifts, departmental funds, University unrestricted funds, University facilities reserves, debt, and Stanford Infrastructure Program funds.\nc. Setting Up\nA department planning a facilities construction or renovation project works with Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/Department of Capital Planning to initiate the project via the Facilities Form 1 System. When the project receives approval, a copy of the Facilities Form I and PTA set-up form is submitted to the Capital Accounting section of the Controller's Office. Capital Accounting reviews the Form 1 for necessary approvals, appropriateness of sources of funding and fund availability. It also sets up the PTA and sends out an Authorization memo, which includes the appropriate capital PTA, authorized budget, and applicable asset code for the project, notifying the appropriate individuals so they can grant signature authority on the PTA, as needed. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA.\nFor capital asset projects that do not involve facilities (e.g., computer hardware or software systems) the Capital Projects PTA Request Form should be completed and sent to Capital Accounting.\nd. Mid-Project Changes\nIf changes are needed to source of funds, the department informs Capital Accounting. Once funds are committed via the Form I, the department may not withdraw the funding commitment. However, a substitution of one fund source for another can be made.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the entire budget and expenditures for the project are carried forward to the new fiscal year expenditure statements. Expenditures must be fully funded. The department must work with Capital Accounting throughout the year to cover overdrafts.\nf. Closing a Capital Project\nThe project manager informs Capital Accounting that a project has been completed. Capital Accounting reconciles outstanding commitments, closes the project and award, and returns any unexpended funds to their original source.\n7. Student Aid PTA\nA student aid PTA is a special kind of PTA used to record departmental expenditures for student aid from current funds. Student aid PTAs are set up and managed in the same way as Operating Budget, gift, or designated PTAs, depending on the source of funds. See Quick Steps: Request New PTA.\nNote: Salaries to student employees and graduate research and teaching assistant tuition allowance are not student aid.\n8. Auxiliary PTA\na. Purpose\nAuxiliary enterprises are self-supporting entities that support the University's teaching and research mission. They service principally faculty, students, staff and the Stanford community. Major University auxiliaries include Housing and Dining Services, Stanford University Press, and the Department of Athletics.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe source of funds for auxiliary PTAs is the income generated by the auxiliary activity. The amount budgeted for the fiscal year is based on a forecast of expected income and expenses for the year.\nc. Setting Up\nTo set up a new auxiliary account, the department sends a memo to Fund Accounting with the appropriate information. The Fund Accounting PTA Request form is located here. \nd. PTA Management\nAuxiliaries are managed similarly to a business enterprise. In addition to income and expense activities, they may have assets, liabilities, and reserve (fund) PTAs.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAny surplus or deficit is transferred at year-end to a reserve PTA of the auxiliary.\nf. Closing an Auxiliary P, T, and / or A\nAt any time during the year, the auxiliary may send a memo to Fund Accounting requesting that a P, T, and/or A for the auxiliary be closed. The memo should include the reason for closing the account. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n9. Service Center PTA\na. Purpose\nA service center is an organizational unit of the University that provides a specific service, group of services, or products to users principally within the University. Large service centers include Information Technology Services (ITS), Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE), and the Medical School's Veterinary Service Center. Smaller service centers are typically found within academic departments. Detailed information on Service Centers is available at DoResearch.\nb. Authorization\nProposals for a new service center must have the approval of the department chair and school dean, or their equivalent for nonacademic areas. The Office of Research Administration Policy and Compliance (RAPC) is responsible for setting service center policy and reviewing annual budget submissions which should include the volume projection for services, and ensure the costs are compliant with Federal as well as University regulations. Review the Service Center Manual for additional information.\nc. Annual Breakeven\nAll service centers must annually break even, unless ONR has granted an exception. Twelve months of operational expense should be allocated to users via twelve months of allocation journals. If the year-end under-recovery exceeds 5% of expenses including the prior year balance for administrative service centers or 15% for academic service centers then either the users are charged the under-recovered amount or the service center's department will need to subsidize the entire loss. If the year-end over-recovery exceeds the 5% or 15% limit, a rebate must be allocated to all users of the service center. The breakeven calculation is fully explained here. \nd. Source of Funds\nThe costs of service center services or products are charged directly to all users based on the actual level of activity using a nondiscriminatory rate schedule. This rate schedule (the service center rate) must be calculated to recover no more or no less than the estimated aggregate cost of the service or product over a fiscal year unless otherwise agreed upon by the federal government.\ne. Setting Up\nWhen a new service center is reviewed and approved by RAPC, RAPC will open a new PTA. Some of the information required to open a new service center includes the purpose of the service center, anticipated usage, list of anticipated internal and external users, estimated initial budget, list of capital assets that will be required for the service center operation and a valid Guarantee PTA account. All academic service centers must have a guarantee account, which can be an operating budget, Dean's Executive fund, or unrestricted gift PTA designated by the school dean or department head. See the \"Request for Establishing a New Service Center\" PTA setup document.\nf. Mid-Year Changes\nRequests to change a service center rate should be made as soon as it appears an administrative service center will not break even within +/-5% at year-end or an academic service center will not break even within +/-15% at year-end using the previously approved rates. Such requests much be routed to the appropriate service center analyst for review and approval before the new rate can be used. A list of service center analysts is available online.\ng. Fiscal Year End\nService center balances at fiscal year end must be within +/- 5% of an administrative service center's annual expenditures, including the prior year balance and +/- 15% of an academic service center's annual expenditures, including prior year balances. When any over-recovery exceeds break-even percentage, the entire surplus balance must be refunded to all users in an equitable manner. When any under-recovery exceeds the applicable percentage, the entire deficit balance must be cleared either by either charging the service center's Guarantee PTA or by allocating a yearend assessment of the entire loss to all users on a prorated usage basis. Service centers that operate under special long-term break-even or pricing agreements with the government will not be required to break even at year-end.\nh. Closing a Service Center PTA\nThe department will need to clear any remaining balance before RAPC can close the service center PTA.\n10. Expenditure Allocation PTA\na. Purpose\nAn expenditure allocation (expense clearing) PTA is a departmental expenditure PTA used to accumulate specific costs as a means of expediting the processing of accounting transactions. Expenditure allocation PTAs are used when the final distribution of expenses is unknown at the time the expenses are incurred. Expenditure allocation PTAs are cleared via iJournals or Labor Distribution adjustments. Labor and material costs cannot be combined in the same expenditure allocation PTA. If labor and material expenses must be combined, the department should establish a service center PTA (see section 9). For related information, see AGM 3.2.3: Allocation and Offsets. Please refer to the DoResearch site for additional guidance on the use of expenditure allocation PTAs.\nb. Authorization\nExpenditure allocation PTAs must have the approval of the requesting department's Administrative Service Manager and an individual with financial authority over the guarantee PTA.\nc. Source of Funds\nThe requesting department must identify and provide resources to guarantee the expenditure allocation PTA. Funds from sponsored awards may not be used as the guarantee. Guarantees generally come from unrestricted, gift, endowment income, or designated funds. The fund source will be used to guarantee any uncleared expenses at the end of the fiscal year.\nd. Setting Up\nWhen a department needs a new expenditure allocation PTA it requests Research Administration Policy and Compliance (RAPC) to set it up by submitting the Request For Expenditure Allocation PTA form. RAPC will review the allocation method(s) to be used by the account administrator and maintain records to support the establishment of the PTA.\n11. Receivables PTA\nA department that administers a program such as a conference or professional journal sponsored by an organization outside the University must use a receivables PTA for expenses incurred on campus. Operating budgets, designated funds and restricted funds cannot be used for such activities. To open a receivables account, contact the Receivables Accounting section of the Controller's Office.\n12. Account Maintenance\nCertain information gathered at the time the account is established may change over time. The information includes the Owner, Manager and Owning-Organization of the Project, Task and Award. This information is crucial to reporting on and analyzing financial activity and may impact authority and approvals. When a change occurs due to turnover or business reorganization the department must update PTA roles and owning, as described at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/expenditure-management/allocations-and-offsets","text":"3.2.3 Allocations and Offsets | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 38.1\nThis Guide Memo sets out policies and procedures for expense allocations and salary distribution offsets, which are a form of cost transfer.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all Stanford employees responsible for accounting transactions.\n1. Expense Allocation Policies\nAn expense allocation is a method that enables apportionment of a particular expense or expenses to Projects-Tasks-Awards (PTAs) that specifically benefit from those charges. Allocations are used in situations where it is difficult to determine in advance how much to charge each PTA for a shared supply or service. They are used to distribute expenses to PTAs receiving the benefit of the good or service. Allocations are often used to distribute costs from expenditure allocation PTAs (formerly knows as \"clearing accounts\") or service centers. They may also be used to distribute costs between benefiting PTAs when a purchase was originally charged to one PTA and one or more other PTAs also benefited from the purchase. Allocations are also used to distribute charges from independent systems (known as \"feeders\") into the financial system. Often allocations are repetitive or are required on a regular basis.\na. Expenditure Allocation PTA Definition\nAn expenditure allocation PTA, as described in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTAs) is a special PTA in which charges for materials, supplies, services, or salaries are accumulated, and then allocated each month to PTAs receiving the benefit of the good or service. Salary and material costs cannot be combined in the same expenditure allocation PTA. If salary and material expenses must be combined, a service center must be used. Sponsored project PTAs may not be used as expenditure allocation PTAs.\nb. Allocation Basis\nThe basis of allocation/distribution (e.g., effort, square footage, headcount) must logically relate to the type of costs being allocated. It must produce an allocation to each activity/account in reasonable proportion to the benefits received. The allocation methodology must produce a result that is allowable, allocable, reasonable and consistent. Feeder systems typically charge other departments based on usage or services provided at specified rates. Administrative expenses may not be distributed or rotated among sponsored agreements. Departments shall not use any type of pooled allocation method to charge expenses to federal sponsored agreements except from a service center with approved rates, or as described in the Research Policy Handbook. For more information, see Research Administration Policy and Compliance.\nc. Documentation\nOnline expense allocation documentation must clearly show the nature of the cost being allocated. The originator of the journal must include comments about the distribution basis in the online documentation and retain documentation of the allocation methodology and calculation results in accordance with the government and University's record retention requirements. Feeder systems track the charges and maintain documentation in their own systems.\nd. Approvals\nBefore an allocation journal or feeder is submitted to the financial system, the department processing the journal/feeder must have received approval from an authorized individual for each PTA charged. Certain feeder transactions, such as utility charges, are approved implicitly as part of the annual budget process. Approval for other allocations and feeders can be a \"blanket\" approval for regular ongoing costs allocated in a consistent manner. Approval can be evidenced in writing in a memo, on a request form (e.g., SU-13 or similar form) or via electronic means. The department originating the journal/feeder must maintain documentation of written approval. For allocation journals, written approval must be on file from individuals with signature authority over the PTAs being charged, while online approval is required for the PTA or Project-Fund-Object being credited. The originator of the journal attests to the following when creating the allocation journal:\nThis allocation is being processed in accordance with policy\nThe cost is an appropriate charge to the PTAs sharing the expense\nThe PTA actually benefited from the cost of the goods and services\nThe transaction is documented according to policy\nFeeder transactions are not routed for online approval, nor does the originator make the above attestation in the financial system. The ability to act as a feeder into the financial system is granted by the Controller's Office with the understanding that the transactions follow University policy. Feeder business process owners must sign an annual attestation that they understand and accept their responsibilities and have followed the policies. For information on university policy for iJournal expense transfers, refer to Administrative Guide Policy 3.2.2: Cost Transfers.\ne. Deadlines\nAllocation journals should be prepared and submitted before the end of the month following the month the expense was posted.Example: A cost that appears on an expenditure allocation PTA's March expenditure or operating statement should be allocated to the PTAs that benefited from the service by the last working day in April. Allocations submitted after the deadlines must include a valid reason for the delay.\n2. Salary Distribution Offset Policies\nThe federal government and some nongovernment sponsors require that the University charge salaries and wages to sponsored projects as they are earned. However, many faculty members who are on 9-, 10-, or 11-month appointments choose to have a reduced salary amount paid over all 12 months of the year. To correctly charge sponsored project PTAs or the related cost sharing PTAs in such situations, departments may use the Labor Distribution Schedule method or the Salary Distribution Offset method. The Labor Distribution Schedule method is preferred, as it requires fewer accounting transactions to accomplish the result. In the employee's Oracle Labor Distribution Schedule sponsored or cost sharing PTAs are charged the appropriate percentage of the faculty member's 9-month salary (subject to any regulatory caps) for the academic period. The remainder of the amount to be PAID over 12 months is charged to an operating budget or other unrestricted PTA. For templates to aid in the calculation, see Faculty Labor Distribution Entry Templates. When following the Salary Distribution Offset (using after-the-fact Labor Distribution Adjustments for salary expenses originally incurred after March 31, 2005, or Salary Journals for salary expenses originally incurred before April 1, 2005) method the department must:\nCharge the faculty member's entire salary to the operating budget PTA paying for the non-research portion of salary. (For more information on payroll processing see Guide Memo 2.2.3: University Payroll, and Faculty Specific Payroll Administration. \nRecord a transfer to allocate the amount of earned salary to the sponsored project(s).The salary actually paid will show as a charge on the expenditure detail report for the operating budget PTA. The salary earned will show as a charge on the sponsored project expenditure detail report and as a credit on the operating budget expenditure detail report.\na. Approvals\nOnline signature of the person responsible for the PTA to be debited is required. Signature for the PTA to be credited is not required.\nb. Deadlines\nSalary Distribution Offset transfers should be prepared and submitted in the month the salary is earned.Example: Salary earned during April should be recorded during April.A Salary Distribution Offset transfer submitted after the deadline must include a valid reason for the delay.\n3. Allocation and Offset Procedures\na. Getting Started\nAllocations and offsets, including feeders, are submitted using iJournals or Labor Distribution Adjustments in the University's online financial system. Guidance on using the University's online accounting system, including procedures for using Allocation and Salary Journals, Uploads, Templates, and Labor Distribution Adjustments, is available from the Month-End/Year-End Close section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nb. Nonsalary Charges\nAllocations from expenditure allocation PTAs, service centers or other PTAs may be made by the following methods:\nAllocation Journals are used for submitting a new allocation, a transaction containing repetitive transfers where charges have been previously authorized. Journal transactions entered using this form are limited to non-salary/student-aid expenditure types.\nAllocation Templates may be set up to save time in processing repetitive allocations each month.\nUpload Allocation and Feeder Journals may be used to upload an allocation created in another system.\nc. Salary Charges\nAllocations from expenditure allocation PTAs or offsets are made by using a Labor Distribution Adjustment or a Salary Journal. See Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, for further guidance.\nd. Authorization Requirements\nAll users of university’s financial systems must have an active SUNet ID and password. Financial transaction preparers and approvers must be granted appropriate authority privileges using the Authority Manager system and complete required training. For more information, see Authority to Create Financial Transactions and Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford’s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\ne. Review\nTo ensure compliance with this Guide Memo, the Office of Sponsored Research will periodically sample and review the supporting documentation. Originators may contact the Office of Sponsored Research for further guidance, see the DoResearch website."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/infrastructure-charges-and-expendable-funds/expendable-funds","text":"3.3.2 Expendable Funds Investment, Return Allocation and Buffer Policy\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer. Approved by the Stanford University Board of Trustees on December 5, 2017.\nLast Updated\nJanuary 16, 2024 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 37.4\nThis policy replaces the “Expendable Funds Investment, Interest Allocation and Buffer Policy” adopted by the Board of Trustees on June 9, 2016. The policy was most recently updated by the Board of Trustees on June 13, 2023 and December 4, 2023.\n1. Expendable Funds Investment and Return Allocation Policy\nThe university has two pools for managing expendable funds, the Endowment Income Funds Pool (“EIFP”) and the Expendable Funds Pool (“EFP”).\na. Endowment Income Funds Pool\nThe EIFP comprises funds holding unspent prior year payout distributed from pure endowment funds (including amounts reinvested in those funds).\nInvestment Policy: One hundred percent of the assets in the EIFP are to be invested in cash and liquid short-term investment vehicles managed in the Short-term Investment Pool (“STIP”). \nReturn Allocation Policy: Each endowment income fund holding unspent prior years’ payout will receive an allocation equal to the net return on the STIP, less the cost to administer the portfolio.\nb. Expendable Funds Pool\nThe EFP holds the following types of expendable funds:\nEndowment Income Funds – current year payout distributed from pure endowment funds and all payout from Funds Functioning as Endowment (“FFE”) not yet expended\nRestricted Funds – gifts or other restricted expendable funds not yet expended\nDesignated Funds – funds designated for a specific school, department, faculty or purpose, not yet expended\nUnrestricted Funds – university, school, department, auxiliary or faculty funds held in reserve or pending expenditure\nGifts Pending Designation – gift funds received for which the purpose has not yet been designated and which are not invested in the Merged Pool or Intermediate Pool\nPlant Funds – funds designated for facilities, not yet expended.\nRecycling Pool – proceeds from internal debt amortization available to lend to projects\nInsurance and Benefit Program Reserves – reserves held for claims within self-insurance programs\nStudent Loan Funds – funds available to lend for student loans\nAgency Funds – funds held by Stanford University on behalf of third parties\nInvestment Policy\nDepending on the University’s operating and other liquidity requirements, the University’s Chief Financial Officer or their designee will determine appropriate balances to be invested in the Intermediate Pool (IP) or cash and liquid investment vehicles managed in the STIP. The remainder of the EFP is to be cross-invested in the MP. The University may also draw on a bank line or other debt vehicle to fund liquidity needs as deemed necessary by the University’s Chief Financial Officer or their designee. \nReturn Allocation Policy\nFunds invested in the EFP are grouped into two categories for purposes of allocating investment returns.\na. Money-Market Accounts\nThe following types of Expendable Funds will be treated as “Money-Market Accounts” and will receive an allocation equal to the net return on the STIP:\nRestricted Funds, only when stipulated by donor requirement\nGifts Pending Designation, excluding class gift funds and donor funds of less than $100,000\nPlant Funds, raised from gifts exceeding $1 million\nInsurance and Benefit Program Reserves\nStudent Loan Funds\nAgency Funds\nb. Zero-Interest Accounts\nAll other Expendable Funds will be treated as “Zero-Interest Accounts.” Investment returns on these funds will not be allocated to the individual fund, but will be accumulated and distributed to the Provost’s General Fund and to the School of Medicine (“SoM”) and Graduate School of Business (“GSB”) Dean’s Unrestricted Funds, as described below: \nSoM Dean’s Unrestricted Fund will receive an allocation related to zero-interest account balances controlled by the SoM dean’s office, departments and faculty.\nGSB Dean’s Unrestricted Fund will receive an allocation related to zero-interest account balances controlled by the GSB dean’s office, departments and faculty.\nProvost’s General Fund will receive an allocation related to all other zero-interest account balances.\nEffective Sept. 1, 2024, the allocation shall be 5.5% of the zero-interest account average monthly balances during the prior fiscal year.\n2. Buffer Policy\nThe total allocation to Money-Market Accounts, General Fund and Dean's Unrestricted Funds will differ from the investment returns of the EFP. These differences will be buffered by the \"Tier I Buffer\" and the \"Tier II Buffer.\"\nThe Tier I Buffer is the University's unrestricted FFE funds, excluding Land Development Funds. These funds are fully invested in the MP and receive a regular MP-based payout used to support the Provost's General Fund.\nThe Tier II Buffer is a single unrestricted FFE fund. This fund is primarily invested in the MP. A fraction of the Tier II Buffer is invested in separately managed investments such as the President’s Venture Fund. The portion of the Tier II Buffer invested in the MP receives a regular MP-based payout that is distributed at the President’s discretion (“President’s Funds”). In addition, the President is authorized to withdraw up to $30 million in principal each year to be used at their discretion.\nTo the extent there is a shortfall in EFP investment returns relative to stipulated allocations, principal will be withdrawn from the Tier I and Tier II Buffers to make up such shortfall, as follows:\nFirst, from the Tier I Buffer up to a limit of 20% of the fiscal year-end market value of the Tier I Buffer in any fiscal year\nSecond, from the Tier II Buffer until fully depleted\nThird, from the remainder of the Tier I Buffer\nTo the extent there is a surplus of EFP investment returns relative to stipulated allocations, excess returns will be added to the Tier I and Tier II Buffers as follows:\nFirst, to the Tier I Buffer until such time as the value of the Tier I Buffer, in total, equals 35% of the total value of the EFP (\"the target threshold\")\nSecond, to the Tier II Buffer"}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/financial-administration/funds-management/retention-financial-records","text":"3.1.5 Retention of Financial Records\nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJune 15, 2012 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.4\nThis Guide Memo covers time requirements for retaining financial records and security requirements for disposing of old records.\n1. Purpose of Record Retention\nRetaining records serves two purposes. In the short-term, it provides those responsible for the management of accounts with the means to monitor transactions and resolve problems. In the long-term, it enables the University to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service regulations, and other federal, state and local regulations governing auditability and retention of records.\n2. Responsibility\na. Online Transactions\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is online, the central administrative office responsible for maintaining the online application is responsible for retaining the online transaction record.\nb. Paper Documents\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is paper, the office that receives the original document is responsible for retaining it. The submitting department is responsible for retaining the support until the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report. Originating departments have the responsibility to destroy any paper backup once central administration has successfully processed the reimbursement request, has a copy of the scanned supporting documentation and the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report.\nExceptions:\nFor Federal contracts, a copy of the original paper copy must be retained for one year past the date it was scanned;\neither a paper copy or scanned copy of the monthly grant and contract expenditure statements or quarterly certification statement signed by the principal investigator and task manager should be retained by the department in accordance with the \"Direct Charges and Revenues to Contracts and Grants\" retention policy.\n3. Retention Times\na. Minimum Paper and Electronic Record Retention TimesLegal and Audit Requirements\nWhen requirements for long-term retention of records overlap, the responsible office should retain records for the maximum period needed to meet legal and audit requirements. In special cases retention times may be extended by request of the central offices. In such a situation the affected will be notified in writing. General rules:\nTax-Exempt Debt Related Records: Life of the bond issue, plus the life of any issue that refunds the issue, plus six years. Records related to tax-exempt debt include but are not limited to documentation of the use of the debt proceeds (project costs), how debt financed property is used, relevant sponsored research contracts and grants in facilities financed with tax-exempt debt, relevant third party leases of space, etc. Detailed information can be found under the Compliance Guidelines for Tax-Exempt Bonds. \nDirect Charges and Revenues to Contracts and Grants: Four years following the end date of the award (longer if circumstances related to tax-exempt financing require it, see Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records above).\nTransactions involving depreciable assets: \nMoveable equipment records (not financed with tax-exempt debt) will be centrally retained three years beyond the disposal of the asset.\nTransaction records involving other depreciable assets will be retained six years beyond the asset becoming fully depreciated (longer if circumstances related to tax-exempt financing require it, see Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records above.)\nBusiness Transaction Records (not contract or grant-related): Four years.\nEmployee Payroll Information: Six years from retirement or termination.\nTaxable Income (Cash receipt information and billings, and all documents for activities considered unrelated business income. See Guide Memo 1.5.3: Unrelated Business Activity). Four years following the end of the fiscal year. Longer retention times apply to certain documents retained by central offices. For information on a specific document or category of documents, the office responsible for the type of transaction should consult the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR), Research Financial Compliance and Services, or Financial Management Services (FMS) consisting of the Controller's Office, Office of the Treasurer, Procurement (including Accounts Payable, Travel & Reimbursements), Global Services, and Consulting & Support.\nb. Management Information\nWhen a central office has retention responsibility, the department initiating a transaction may discard copies of documentation supporting the transaction when it is no longer needed for management purposes. For example, when the transaction is complete and the expenditure statement containing the transaction has been reviewed. At its discretion, a department may keep copies of documents for longer periods.\n4. Disposal of Old Documents\nTo safeguard the privacy of individuals, documents that contain salary information must be shredded, incinerated, or otherwise disposed of securely. Departments may arrange for service from a business record destruction vendor."}

The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge (ISC) from 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted funds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry an F&A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or transferred.\nGifts for building projects are exempt from the infrastructure charge. The infrastructure charge collected from funds owned by non formula schools will be credited75% to a central University PFOO (project/fund/object code/org code) (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central PFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected from funds owned by formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO belonging to the formula school or auxiliary.\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all.\nApplicability: This policy applies to restricted funds and designated funds effective September 1, 2005.\n1. Purpose\nIf Stanford is to maintain long-term financial stability, restricted and designated funds must contribute to the cost of the University's infrastructure. Activities supported by designated and restricted funds represent a significant percentage of the University's total activity. General funds, alone, cannot bear the full burden of the infrastructure and administrative costs required to support these activities. The purpose of this policy is to recover a portion of these costs.\n2. Assessment on Designated Revenue\nThe infrastructure charge is applied to all external designated revenue at the time it is received. Once the designated revenue is deposited in a fund, no infrastructure charge will be applied to either expenditures against the fund or transfers out of the fund.\n3. Assessment on Restricted Expendable Funds (Gifts)\nThe infrastructure charge is applied at the time the funds are expended or transferred. All expenditure types are subject to the charge.\n4. Assessment on Restricted Endowment Income\nThe infrastructure charge is applied at the time the funds are expended or transferred. Endowment funds whose purpose is restricted by the donor to academic-year tenure line salaries (professorships), undergraduate and graduate student financial aid, or undergraduate research opportunities are not subject to the infrastructure charge. Restricted endowments that are not specifically restricted to these purposes but are used to support these activities will incur the charge.\n5. Assessment on Sponsored Projects\nSponsored project awards that carry an F&A rate (indirect cost rate) of 0% are subject to the infrastructure charge as follows:\nSponsored project awards with start dates prior to September 1, 2005, are subject to the previous infrastructure policy and rate of 6%. Sponsored project awards with start dates on or after September 1, 2005, are subject to the revised policy unless they meet the exception in 5.d (2) below.\nSponsored project awards made in response to proposals submitted using the previous infrastructure policy and rate of 6% will be subject to the previous policy and rate until the end of their competitive segment. A new competitive segment will be subject to the revised infrastructure policy.\nProposals submitted on or after September 1, 2005, are subject to the revised infrastructure policy.\nThe revised infrastructure policy applies to sponsored projects as follows: \nNo sponsored project award is assessed the infrastructure charge if the award is already paying indirect costs (IDC). Awards paying less than 8% indirect costs are not charged ISC but instead are charged their applicable IDC rates.\nThe infrastructure charge is assessed on non-government sponsored project awards and awards sponsored by foreign governments. U.S. Government awards (federal, state and local government agencies) are excluded from infrastructure.\nThe infrastructure charge is automatically exempted, but not waived (an alternate PTA must be provided by the principal investigator/ department to pay the infrastructure charge) on all non-government and foreign government awards where the sponsor has a written policy stating it does not pay indirects and the sponsor/program is on OSR's (Office of Sponsored Research) pre-approved IDC waiver list. A request to exempt the award from the infrastructure charge is not required.\nFor all other sponsors who will not pay indirect costs, a request to exempt the award from the infrastructure charge must be submitted and approved by the Provost and the CFO before an institutional official approves the proposal for submission to the funding agency.\nAll cost-sharing is exempt.\nInstitutional allowances for federally-sponsored projects are exempt.\n6. Exceptions to the Policy\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all. If a donor/sponsor will not allow the infrastructure charge to be applied to a restricted fund, then either the gift/award will have to be refused or the Provost and the CFO may grant an exemption. If an exemption is granted, then the unit receiving the funds must identify an alternative source of funding to pay the infrastructure charge. To request an exemption, complete the \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form, following the guidelines posted with the form. \n7. ISC Implementation Guide\nThe ISC Implementation Guide provides additional detail about how the revised ISC policy is implemented. The guide can be found at the DoResearch website. \n8. Additional Sources of Information\nA list of expenditure types subject to infrastructure can be found on the Burden Expenditure Type Mapping Schedule (Excel spreadsheet).\nFor sponsored project awards subject to the previous infrastructure policy, the prior implementation guideline can be found here.\nFor policy clarification contact appropriate members of the Budget Office, Controller's Office Fund Accounting or Office of Sponsored Research described at the DoResearch website."}

Some common types of financial irregularities are corruption (e.g., bribery, kickbacks, bid riggings, etc.), conflicts of interest (e.g., sale and purchase schemes, etc.) and asset misappropriation involving cash, inventory or other University assets. Examples of asset misappropriation can include the following:\ntheft of cash\nthe use of a University issued credit card or the expense reimbursement system to make personal purchases\nthe directing of University resources such as supplies, inventory or labor to outside organizations\nthe directing of University revenues (e.g., event ticket proceeds, research funding, etc.) to outside organizations\nDepartments must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline of suspected financial irregularities. Departments should not initiate an investigation. Departments should not discuss, interview or confront individuals about the suspected financial irregularity. Departments should not initiate any disciplinary actions without specific direction from the Office of General Counsel, or the Office of the Chief Risk Officer.\n1. Notification\nThe department where the alleged financial irregularity is suspected or discovered must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Compliance and Ethics helpline, at (650)-721-2667 or helpline.stanford.edu. Preliminary research will be conducted to determine if an investigation is warranted. In general, there must be an adequate basis for suspecting a possible illegal or improper act and sufficient information available to conduct an investigation.\n2. Investigation Process\nWhen warranted by information obtained during preliminary research, the Office of the Chief Risk Officer will commence a fact-finding investigation into the suspected financial irregularity. Depending on the circumstances, the Office of the General Counsel may decide to direct the investigation. If an investigation is commenced, the Office of the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, and all appropriate stakeholders will be notified. These may include representatives from the following offices:\nDepartment where the alleged financial irregularity is suspected or discovered, unless the local senior management is alleged to be involved or there is concern that informing local management could compromise the outcome of the investigation\nFinancial Management Services, including the Controller's Office, Office of the Treasurer, Procurement, Global Services, and Financial Management Consulting and Support\nUniversity Human Resources\nStudent Affairs\nDean's, Vice Provost's or Vice President's Office to which the department reports\nProvost's Office\nDepartment of Public Safety (if the report involves allegations of criminal activity)\nThe Office of the Chief Risk Officer will plan and coordinate the investigation and will consult with the Office of the General Counsel as appropriate.

Revenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition should be based on accrual accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Revenues should be recognized when earned, and expenses should be recognized when incurred. Revenue is considered earned when the University has substantially met its obligation to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenue. Revenue should be recorded when earned, regardless of the timing of cash receipts. In the event a project stipulates performance measures, revenue is considered earned when the performance measures have been completed. Deposits (whether refundable or non-refundable), early payments and progress payments should not be recognized as revenue until the revenue producing event has occurred.\n2.

Section 5 of this policy applies to all third-party vendors or service providers that conduct business at Stanford.\n1. Definition\nThe term \"card or payment account\" as used in this policy includes the use of credit or debit card accounts or account numbers (such as a bank account) or third party account numbers (such as a PayPal or Google accounts). For purposes of this policy, card or payment account acceptance and processing is defined as using any application or device for accepting a card or payment account as payment for goods or services sold by a Stanford University entity. This policy does not apply to the Stanford Card Plan, Cardinal Dollars or to the University's PCard or Travel credit card programs.\n2. Purpose\nA card or payment account provides a convenient way to handle business transactions such as conference registration, the purchase of course materials, or the purchase of meals at a campus dining facility. In order to accept card or payment account payments it is the University's best interest that the acceptance and processing is compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards for safeguarding card numbers, account numbers, and other High Risk Data as listed in Administrative Guide Memo 6.3.1: Information Security. In addition, funds from payments must be securely transferred to the University's financial systems. This policy is to establish guidelines for card or payment account acceptance and processing.\n3.

Departments must comply with Administrative Guide Memo 6.3.1: Information Security, and safeguard the confidentiality of High Risk Data related to purchases of goods or services. They may not store any High Risk card or payment account information. They must only use equipment authorized by the Office of the Treasurer to process payment information and are required to use secure and approved, or PCI DSS certified, encrypted connections to transmit payment information.\ne. For departments operating electronic commerce websites:\nDepartments must post a privacy policy on their website that is approved by the University Privacy Officer or the Office of the General Counsel. Vendors and/or Service Providers who independently collect card or third party account information must have privacy and terms of use policies on their websites. These policies must conform to applicable federal and state laws, as well as the University's privacy policies.\nThird-party advertising is not allowed on any web pages which are hosted on the stanford.edu domain, or which use Stanford's name or emblems. Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the Vice President for Business Affairs and CFO. Advertising does not include mentioning the name of third parties that are co-sponsoring events with Stanford.\n4.

{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/gifts-university/gifts-university","text":"4.1.1 Gifts to the University\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 41\nStanford University relies upon gifts from alumni, parents of students, friends, corporations, associations, and foundations to meet a substantial portion of its operating costs. This Guide Memo outlines policies on procurement, classification, management, and use of gifts.\n1. Definition\nA gift is any item of value given to the University by a donor who expects nothing of value in return, other than recognition (for example, being listed on an honor roll or naming a building, fund, professorship, etc. in the donor's honor).\na. \"Quid Pro Quo\" Situations\nIf the University has given something of value in return for a gift, the donor's tax deduction is reduced by the fair market value of the benefit received. All \"quid pro quo\" gifts or gift solicitations must be reported to and cleared with the Office of Development. Contact Gift Processing, (650) 725-4360, or the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, in the Office of Development for further information.\nb. Non-Gifts\n(1) Sponsored Projects\nConsult the Research Policy Handbook 13.1 for the distinction between gifts and sponsored projects.\n(2) Income\nPayment received for goods or services must be handled as income. See Guide Memo 1.5.3: Unrelated Business Activities.\n(3) Non-Gift Financial Aid for a Named Student\nSupport received from an outside individual or institution for the purpose of paying the tuition or other educational expenses of a specifically named student, where the University has no discretion in the assignment of the funds for any other student(s), is actually a gift to the specifically-named individual rather than to the University, and is accounted for by Stanford as Student Financial Aid. Such checks are to be sent, along with all accompanying documentation, to the Financial Aid Office, which will appropriately account for the payment.\n2. General Information\na. Designation of Gifts to Stanford\nAll gifts, regardless of value, form, or designated use, should be made payable to, or title should be transferred in the name of, Stanford University or the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University. However, donors of securities can facilitate Stanford's gift processing effort by not re-registering the securities before giving them to the University.\nb. Recording of Gifts\nAll gifts of cash, securities, real estate, and capital equipment are recorded at market value as of the date of the gift by the Gift Processing section of the Office of Development and/or the Controller's Office. (See Guide Memos 4.2.2: Acknowledgement of Gifts and 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment.) Gifts of tangible personal property (other than capital equipment covered under Guide Memo 4.2.3) may be recorded if Development Services receives adequate documentation, including sufficient information for valuation. \nc. Information About Gifts\nQuestions about methods of giving, assignment, acknowledgment, recording, restrictions on, or purpose of a gift should be directed to the Office of Development. Questions about legal documentation, tax benefits, or requirements for gifts should be directed to the Office of Planned Giving, Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, (650) 725-4358.\n3. Responsibilities\na. Board of Trustees\nThe Board of Trustees is the legal entity to which all gifts to the University are made and has responsibility for ensuring that gifts are properly accepted (or refused), processed, acknowledged, and used according to their terms and restrictions and in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal laws.\nb. University President and Provost\nThe President and Provost have ultimate administrative responsibility for determining the use of both unrestricted and restricted gifts, setting priorities for gift fundraising, and reviewing and setting policies concerning gifts, in consultation with the Board of Trustees.\nc. Vice President for Development\nThe Vice President is responsible for managing the University's gift procurement and processing operations, for coordinating the fundraising operations of all Schools and Institutes, and for implementing policies set by the Board of Trustees, the Provost, and the President.\n4. Affiliated Organizations\nCertain groups affiliated with Stanford that raise funds for University purposes may derive tax-deductible status for donors' contributions if gifts are made to and processed through the University. Such groups are encouraged to contact and consult with the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, prior to conducting any fundraising effort or event to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws as well as with University policy.\na. Stanford Associates\nThis group of Stanford alumni and friends was formed in 1935 to encourage financial support of the University and recognize those donors who make important contributions, either in terms of money or time. For information please contact Stanford Associates at 326 Galvez, (650) 725-4340.\nb. Student Organizations\nStudent organizations must apply to the ASSU Office of Student Activities at Stanford University as well as the Office of Development prior to soliciting potential donors, and work in conjunction with the Office of Development to plan and implement their fundraising efforts. Student organizations registered with the Office of Student Activities that receive gifts should contact the ASSU administrator to arrange for processing of those gifts through the University's gift processing system.\n5. Gift Procurement Policies\na. Gift Classification\n(1) Cash and Checks\n(preferably made payable to Stanford University).\n(2) Noncash Gifts\nBesides cash and checks, Stanford receives noncash gifts described below. Donors should be aware that tax laws distinguish between certain types of gifts for purposes of determining their charitable contribution deduction (see Section 5).\nMarketable Property — Gifts that are readily sold such as securities (e.g., stocks and bonds), real estate, and salable personal property.\nGifts in Kind — Gifts to be used in the form in which they are given, such as art objects, books, equipment, etc.\nRights and Insurance — Gifts which assign to the University the right to receive payments such as royalties or licensing fees, or that vest ownership in copyrights or trademark rights, and insurance policies that name the University as a beneficiary.\nb. Donor Designation of Gift Use\n(1) Expendable and Endowment Gifts\nA gift may be designated by the donor as expendable (i.e., immediately usable for current purposes), or as endowment (i.e., to be invested and held in perpetuity, with only the Board determined payout available to support University purposes). While donor intent is usually clear, certain types of gifts, such as bequests, may need additional research. Gifts will be recorded as expendable unless there is specific indication otherwise. Expendable gifts are invested in the Expendable Funds Pool; see Guide Memo 3.3.2: Expendable Funds Investment and Payout, for more information. Endowment gifts are invested in one of the University's merged pools depending on the donor's terms; contact Fund Accounting at (650) 723-9773 for more information. For further advice concerning donor designation of expendable and endowment gifts, contact the Office of Planned Giving in the Office of Development, (650) 725-4358.\n(2) Purpose\nAbsent stipulations of purpose from the donor, gifts will be recorded as unrestricted expendable funds to support University purposes. If the donor designates a specific purpose for use of the gift (e.g., scholarships, student housing, a particular department, etc.) then the gift is considered to be restricted and the University is responsible for assuring that restrictions on use are honored unless (i) the donor specifically waives the restriction or (ii) court approval to change or void the restriction is granted. Approval to seek changes in the purpose of a gift fund by the above means can only be granted by the Provost; contact the Office of Planned Giving for instructions, (650) 725-4358.\n(3) Establishing a Fund\nThe department is responsible for instructing Gift Processing whether an existing fund should be credited with a gift (in which case, the fund number must be supplied), or whether a new fund should be established. Gifts with different restrictions may not be commingled in a common fund. If the donor designates a specific purpose and/or named fund, and no appropriate fund already exists, the department should forward the gift and all relevant original documentation to Gift Processing. Gift Processing will then coordinate with the Fund Accounting section of the Controller's Office, which establishes funds and records restrictions. Contact Fund Accounting for questions relating to a particular fund, (650) 723-9773.\n6. Tax Considerations\nThe Internal Revenue Service has several requirements that relate to donor tax deductions for cash and noncash gifts to charities.\na. Receipts\nIt is Stanford's policy to issue receipts for all gifts (see Guide Memo 4.2.2: Acknowledgement of Gifts). The IRS requires a receipt to substantiate most charitable contribution deductions. The donor should retain the receipt in their records; it need not be filed with the tax return.\nb. Deductibility\nGifts to Stanford University are usually deductible at their full fair market value as of the date of the gift for both state and federal tax purposes. One important exception to this rule is that for gifts of tangible personal property that are intended to be resold by the University, the donor is entitled to an income tax deduction that is the lesser of the item's fair market value or the donor's cost basis. Contact the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358 for more information. Tax laws governing charitable gifts are complex; the University encourages donors to seek professional advice on tax issues.\nc. Noncash Charitable Contributions (IRS Form 8283)\n(1) Noncash Gifts Over $500\nIf a donors wishes to claim an income tax deduction of $500 or more in any year for gifts to charity which are not cash, then the donor must file IRS Form 8283 (Noncash Charitable Contributions) with their federal income tax return. Form 8283 is available from the Office of Planned Giving.\n(2) Noncash Gifts Over $5,000\nIn addition, if a donor wishes to claim charitable income tax deductions totaling $5,000 or more in any tax year for gifts that are not cash or publicly traded securities, then the donor needs to obtain qualified appraisals of the property donated and Stanford must acknowledge receipt by signing the IRS Form 8283, which the donor then files with their federal income taxes along with the qualified appraisal in certain cases. Donor should consult with their tax advisors on the filing requirements. Normally Stanford cannot provide or pay for an appraisal for a donor's tax purposes, nor will the University attempt to estimate the fair market value of any real or personal property gift.\nForm 8283 is processed either through the Property Management Office (PMO) (for gifts of capital equipment) or the Office of Development (for all other noncash gifts) and signed by the Accounting Officer in the Controller's Office. The individual accepting the gift should make sure that the donor's name and Social Security number are on the Form 8283, and that the Accounting Officer is provided with the donor's address. It is the donor's responsibility to notify the University that they will require Stanford's acknowledgment on Form 8283.\n(3) Gifts of Securities\nSecurities Not Publicly Traded\nA qualified appraisal and Stanford's acknowledgment of receipt on IRS Form 8283 are required for gifts of securities that are not publicly traded if their total value is more than $10,000.\nPublicly Traded Securities\nAdditional documentation is not required for gifts of publicly traded securities (regardless of their value).\nd. Donee Information Return (IRS Form 8282)\nUnder certain circumstances described below, if Stanford sells, transfers, exchanges or otherwise disposes of donated property within two years of the date of receipt of the property, Stanford must file Form 8282 (Donee Information Return) with the IRS reporting such action. A department that becomes aware of such a disposition should immediately notify the Property Management Office (for capital equipment) or the Accounting Officer in the Controller's Office (for all other property). Among the information required is the name of the donor, their address and tax ID or Social Security number, and any amount received upon disposition. If the transfer is made to a successor donee (that is, another nonprofit entity), information concerning that donee must be included as well. Form 8282 must be filed with the IRS within 125 days of the date of disposition (except as noted in 5.d.(3) below), with a copy to the donor. The Accounting Officer is responsible for preparation of the Form 8282 and its transmittal to the IRS and to the donor. This filing requirement applies only to the following items of donated property or equipment:\nProperty for which Stanford has completed the donee acknowledgment section of the donor's IRS Form 8283 (see above section 5.c.(2)).\nProperty that is considered a restricted donation under Section 170 (e)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. This consists of donated equipment where Stanford has committed 80 percent of its use for research, experimentation, or research training conducted in the United States, in the physical or biological sciences.\nProperty for which Stanford has not completed the donee acknowledgment section of the donor's IRS Form 8283 but which the University later becomes aware should have been so substantiated, e.g. where such property had a fair market value of more than $5,000 as of the date of donation and the donor failed to submit Form 8283 to Stanford for acknowledgment. In this case Form 8282 must be filed within 60 days from the date that the University becomes aware of the omission.\n7. Getting Help\nQuestions about deductibility of gifts, IRS Forms 8282 and 8283, and other tax questions should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving, Office of Development, 326 Galvez, (650) 725-4358."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/receiving-and-processing-gifts/acknowledgment-gifts","text":"4.2.2 Acknowledgment of Gifts | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nJuly 12, 2013 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 42.1\nThis Guide Memo states responsibilities and procedures for acknowledging gifts to the University.\n1. Gift Receipts\nAll gifts to Stanford of cash, checks, and securities, as well as most other types of gifts, are officially acknowledged by the University through the Office of Development. It is the Office of Development's goal to issue a receipt to the donor within 10 working days after Development Services has been notified and received relevant documentation for each gift. Receipts issued by Development Services conform to certain government mandated format requirements, including a statement as to whether the donor has received anything of value in return for the gift and, where applicable, a reference to the University's charge on restricted funds (see Guide Memo 3.3.1: Infrastructure Charges). Under Federal law donors must possess a conforming gift receipt in order to claim a tax deduction for most charitable contributions.\na. Monetary Gifts\nReceipts state the dollar value of the gift.\nb. Securities Gifts\nReceipts describe the number and type of securities donated, and as a courtesy to the donor will generally state the value of any publicly-traded securities credited to the donor's gift record. The value claimed by the donor for tax purposes is the donor's responsibility.\nc. Other Nonmonetary Gifts\nReceipts describe the gift in reasonably specific terms, including number and type of property involved, but do not include a valuation. The value claimed by the donor for tax purposes is the donor's responsibility. For equipment gifts, see Guide Memo 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment. Receipts for gifts of real estate are issued by the Office of Development in coordination with the Gift Real Estate section of the Stanford Management Company.\nd. \"Quid Pro Quo\" Gifts\nUnder federal law, receipts for gifts made to Stanford where the University has given the donor something of value in return must state this fact on the University's gift receipt and must include a valuation of the benefit received by the donor. The donor's tax deduction is reduced by this amount. These requirements do not apply to certain narrowly defined nominal items given in return for a gift (contact Development Services, (650) 725-4360, or Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, for information).\ne. Life Income Gifts\nPlanned Giving in the Office of Development is responsible for preparing and issuing receipts for life income gifts.\n2. Acknowledgment Letters\nIn addition to the University's official gift receipt, certain gifts are acknowledged by a letter signed by the President of the University and/or the Vice President for Development, a School Dean, a Director of a Center, or the Chair of the Board of Trustees. Stewardship Officers throughout the University have the responsibility for tracking gifts that meet certain criteria (which vary slightly from area to area and by signer) and drafting letters for the appropriate signature."}

These sections cover accounting for University fund balances and reconciling and attesting to expenditure statements for sponsored projects, respectively.\n1. Reconciliation Purpose\nAccount balance reconciliations provide reasonable assurance that account balances on the University’s Statement of Financial Position are accurate, complete and valid. Together the account balance reconciliations and account balance attestations are key internal controls that provide reasonable assurance around the following financial statement assertions:\nAccuracy: Transactions were accurately recorded at appropriate amounts.\nCompleteness: All assets, liabilities and net asset balances that should have been recorded were correctly recorded on the Statement of Financial Position.\nExistence: All assets, liabilities and net asset balances that were recorded on the Statement of Financial Position existed at the end of the financial period.\n2. Definitions\nA. Statement of Financial Position\nThe Statement of Financial Position is a financial statement that reports the balances of the University’s assets, liabilities and net assets at a point in time. The Statement of Financial Position is also known as a Balance Sheet. Additional information about the Statement for Financial Position is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nB. Account Balance\nAn account balance on the Statement of Financial Position represents the balance of an asset or liability at a point in time, such as at the end of a month, quarter or year. \nThe University’s assets on the Statement of Financial Position represent resources owned or used by the University and include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, inventory, pledges receivable, loans receivable, investments, and plant facilities. Assets are designated with a 1XXXX series object code or expenditure type in the University’s Chart of Accounts. Assets typically have a debit (positive) balance.\nThe University’s liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position represent debt or obligations to others and include accounts payable, accrued expenses, liabilities associated with investments, notes and bonds payable, and U.S. government refundable loan funds. Liabilities are designated with a 2XXXX series object code or expenditure type in the University’s Chart of Accounts. Liabilities typically have a credit (negative) balance.\nC. Account Balance Reconciliation\nAn account balance reconciliation is the comparison of one or more asset or liability account balances in the general ledger to another, often independent or more detailed source of financial data, such as a bank statement, a subledger or another system. The differences between the account balance and the other source of financial data are reconciling items. Reconciling items may be caused by timing differences or errors, such as general ledger errors, bank errors, or subledger system errors that should be resolved in a timely manner.\n3. Responsibility for Reconciliations\nA. Reconciliation Preparation and Review\nAt least quarterly, each University department with an asset or liability account balance in the general ledger is responsible for designating individuals who are responsible for reconciling and reviewing those balances on all ledgers (typically within 30 days of general ledger close).\nMultiple account balances that are of a similar nature may be reconciled together in one reconciliation, as needed. For some object codes there may be multiple account balances that are the responsibility of different departments. Each department is individually responsible for reconciling its respective balance.\nIn addition to quarterly reconciliations, some account balances must be reconciled and reviewed monthly. The University Controller’s Office designates reconciliation frequency for account balances based on multiple factors including risk, materiality and history.\nIndividuals responsible for reconciling and reviewing cash accounts should also refer to Guide Memo 3.6.1: Bank Accounts and the Office of the Treasurer’s website for additional guidance on bank reconciliations.\nEach University department with an account balance on the Statement of Financial Position is responsible for:\ndeveloping and maintaining desk procedures for account balance reconciliations.\nensuring that account balance reconciliations contain adequate supporting documentation.\nensuring that reconciling items are resolved in a timely manner. \nAccount balance reconciliation best practices and other resources are available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nB. Correction of Transactional Errors\nIf transactional errors are discovered during the account reconciliation, the department is responsible for their correction.\nInformation about how to correct miscoded transactions is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nC. Compliance with Policies and Procedures\nUniversity departments are responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate reconciliation procedures, including reconciliation approval and segregation of duties. Refer to section d. Reconciliation Roles below for additional information about reconciliation segregation of duties.\nUniversity departments are responsible for adhering to department-specific reconciliation policies and procedures. It is recommended that University departments annually review all department-specific reconciliation policies and procedures for accuracy and validity.\nUniversity departments are responsible for adhering to all University policies and procedures during the reconciliation process. This includes but is not limited to adherence to University policies and procedures regarding:\nStewardship of University resources (see section 6 Financial Responsibilities and Internal Controls in Guide Memo 1.1.1.: University Code of Conduct)\nRecord retention of approved reconciliations for future review by the University’s external auditors, internal auditors or the University Controller’s Office (see Guide Memo 3.1.5: Retention of Financial Records)\nObtaining required transaction approvals (see the Financial Authority section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website)\nProcessing and approving Accounts Payable transactions in Oracle (see Guide Memo 5.3 Purchasing and Payments)\nProcessing and approving iJournals (see the Funds Management / About iJournals section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website)\nReporting alleged financial irregularities (see Guide Memo 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities)\nD. Reconciliation Roles\nUniversity departments are responsible for establishing appropriate segregation of duties for account balance reconciliations. Segregation of duties is an internal control that helps safeguard University resources by separating responsibility for a task. The same individual should not prepare and also review a reconciliation. Additionally, University departments are responsible for segregating the reconciliation preparation and activity recording duties. The same individual should not record transactional activity and also reconcile the account balance.\nReconciliation preparation and approval should only be performed by individuals with knowledge of the account balance and an understanding of the reconciliation purpose. Reconciliation reviewers are responsible for ensuring that reconciliation preparers are adequately trained and possess the skill, experience and competence for preparing the reconciliation.\nReconciliation responsibilities are designated by role in the Reconciliation Roles and Responsibilities Matrix in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n4. Reconciliation Review\nThe University Controller’s Office periodically conducts independent reviews of account balance reconciliations. It is expected that reconciliations will be completed prior to the date of request (typically within 30 days of general ledger close) and provided to the Controller’s Office upon request as needed during an audit or other financial statement review. Information about the Reconciliation Review Program is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/receiving-and-processing-gifts/naming-facilities-and-land-features","text":"4.2.5 Naming Facilities and Land Features\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 42.4\nThis Guide Memo covers approval procedures and policies for naming Stanford University facilities and land features.\n1. Approval Procedures\na. New Facilities and Land Features\nNames proposed for Stanford University facilities and land features require the review of the Vice President for Development (or the Vice President’s designate) for possible conflicts and other University-wide implications before submission to the President (or the President’s designate) for approval. Facilities and land features covered by this requirement include: buildings and the components of buildings (classrooms, laboratories, auditoria, conference and seminar rooms); ornamental structures; streets; fountains; courts; plazas; gardens; etc. All gifts related to facilities and land features should be coordinated with the Office of Development. This policy applies to facilities and features developed and used by Stanford including but not limited to the following locations: the Stanford campus and Foothills, Stanford Redwood City Campus, university occupied facilities in the Stanford Research Park, and Hopkins Marine Station.\nb. Renaming Facilities and Land Features\nProposals to remove names from university facilities or land features will follow the process laid out in the \"Principles and Procedures for Renaming Buildings and Other Features at Stanford University\" (hereafter referred to as the \"Principles\").\nAs outlined in the Principles, the President may initiate the process of reconsidering the name of a building or feature, if necessary, in response to a request submitted by members of the university or at their own initiative. For consideration by the President, requests from the community shall contain certain elements described in the Principles.\nIf the renaming process described in the Principles results in a decision to eliminate a name, the President will initiate a process to determine a new name for the feature. This will normally follow the procedure described below in 1.c.\nIn cases of requests for renaming proposed by a university unit, the senior line officer(s) in whose jurisdiction the facility or land feature is located and the Provost must be notified before the request is submitted to the President.\nc. New or Additional Names\nIn cases of proposals for new names that do not require the removal of existing names, the senior line officer(s) in whose jurisdiction the facility or land feature is located should have the sponsorship of the Provost in submitting the recommended name for the approval procedure described in 1.a. Individuals considering proposing a new name must consult with the relevant senior line officer(s) to determine if the feature is available for naming. Requests from the community will normally be considered only with the approval of the relevant senior line officer(s). Note that proposals for new names should be guided by the policies described in Section 2.\nd. Plaques, Trees and Other Similar Memorials\nWhile Stanford gratefully accepts gifts in memory or in honor of someone, the University is not normally able to accommodate requests for plaques, trees, benches, or other physical recognition of such gifts. Donors who wish to make a gift and receive the appropriate recognition should consult with the Office of Development.\n2. Naming Policies and Guidelines\nStanford schools and units rely upon gifts from alumni, parents of students, friends, corporations, associations, and foundations to meet a substantial portion of its operating and capital costs. University donors are often acknowledged for their contribution with the honor of a named feature. Because of the importance of philanthropy in supporting the university’s research and teaching mission, named features are normally associated with a gift to the university.\na. Names of Faculty and Staff\nIn addition to the approval process for naming New Facilities and Land Features in 4.2.5 Section 1.a., names of Stanford faculty and staff to be considered for Stanford University facilities and land features must be selected from individuals who are emeritus, retired or deceased. If the individual has left the university but is not a retiree or emeritus, special approval by the Provost would be required. Schools and departments wishing to honor faculty, staff, or students are encouraged to consider avenues other than naming spaces.\nb. Streets\nStreet names should be historically or geographically significant to the campus. Streets may be named for living individuals, but the use of individuals' names should be minimized.\nc. Donor Names\n(1) Buildings\nDonor names proposed for buildings or portions of buildings are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The \"name\" gift will normally cover between 35 and 70 percent of total project costs.\n(2) Other Features\nDonor names proposed for fountains, ornamental buildings, campus exterior spaces, and similar features will normally require a gift to cover the full cost of the project and a maintenance fund.\nd. Groups\nUniversity features will normally not be named for groups of people (e.g., \"All Californians\"). Exceptions may include families or university classes (e.g., \"Class of 1986\").\ne. Events\nUniversity features will normally not be named for specific events (e.g., \"Big Game 1974\").\n3. Records of Names\nLand, Buildings & Real Estate (LBRE) keeps an official record of all Stanford University campus geographic features and their names. In addition, the Office of Development (OOD) maintains information regarding named spaces when the naming is a result of and tied to a gift. OOD also provides information to LBRE and to the appropriate department or auxiliary organization about the long-term maintenance of the named space and any other relevant consideration."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/operating-policies-development/operating-policies-development","text":"4.3.1 Operating Policies for Development\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 43\nThe Vice President for Development is entrusted with the overall management of Stanford's fundraising programs in order to maximize gift support from alumni, parents, friends, corporations, associations, and foundations. This Guide Memo outlines principles, policies, and procedures that will help assure the wise deployment of University resources, consistency in written communications, and coordination of access to volunteers and prospects.\nApplicability: These policies apply to all gift procurement activities of the University and/or its schools and units. Gifts are defined in Guide Memo 4.1.1: Gifts to the University.\n1. Background\nFor more than five decades, the Office of Development has represented all of Stanford, conveying to alumni, parents, friends and institutions the needs and aspirations of the entire University. Our volunteers, in particular, have responded by working enthusiastically for the University as a whole although they may individually affiliate with and support one or more schools or units. This cooperative and collegial relationship has set Stanford apart from most of its peers.\nDuring the 1990s, we encouraged intensified fundraising programs within the schools/units, many of which conducted individual campaigns. These successful specific initiatives culminated in the Campaign for Undergraduate Education—the largest capital campaign ever launched specifically for undergraduate education. While these individual efforts have been quite successful in developing new and more engaged donors, it is imperative that we continue to nurture a broad understanding and commitment to Stanford University.\nBecause the majority of the University's most generous donors have multiple interests, the advent of unit based campaigns also has created more intense pressure on the prospect population. We need to reinforce the spirit of cooperation that has characterized Stanford's development activities for more than 50 years. That cooperation is based upon open and regular communication between the schools/units and the University development office, and among the schools/units.\nThe ultimate responsibility for securing new gifts for the University rests with the Board of Trustees. The trustees have delegated those responsibilities to the Office of the Development through the President of the University. The Vice President for Development is entrusted with the overall management of Stanford's fundraising programs. Obviously, while many of the fundraising activities may be delegated and carried out at the school/unit level, major development activities, decisions, and solicitations are ultimately managed and coordinated by the Office of the Vice President for Development.\n2. Operating Policies\na. Prospects with Multiple Affiliations\nAll activities with any Stanford prospect with multiple affiliations must be coordinated with all the interested parties. This is especially true for all major rated prospects—$250,000 or more. All prospects rated at this level or higher will be given a primary staff assignment. Any and all solicitation activity on these prospects must be coordinated through the primary staff person.\nb. Prospects Rated at $1,000,000 and Above\nAll prospects with a rating of $1,000,000 and above are, by definition, University prospects. Unless a request to such prospects is for a previously approved annual solicitation, all solicitation activity—even if the solicitation is significantly less than $1,000,000—must be approved by the Office of the Vice President for Development through the Prospect Clearance System (PCS).\nc. Authority of the Vice President for Development\nIf an agreement cannot be reached on assigning or approaching multiple-interest or \"University\" prospects, then the Vice President for Development will determine prospect assignment and access by taking into account priorities set by the President and Provost. The dean or director of a school or unit may appeal the Vice President's decision to the Provost.\nd. Sharing and Storage of Information\nIt is imperative that all pertinent information regarding major gift prospect activity be available across the development enterprise. This is particularly true for $1-million-plus rated prospects. University development staff and school/unit development officers share a responsibility to keep others informed of prospect activity, both formally (by updating the prospect tracking system and sending written communications to Post Grads) and informally (through regular communication). These updates should be entered in a timely fashion to ensure real-time quality to the prospect information.\ne. Volunteers\nSchools and units may form volunteer organizations to support major fundraising initiatives with the approval of the Vice President for Development. Chairs of volunteer groups supporting major fundraising programs will be asked to coordinate their activities through the Board of Trustees' Committee on Development and to work together with University-wide volunteer groups. Enlistment of volunteers, whether for fundraising or for advisory boards and councils, must be coordinated through the Office of the Vice President for Development.\nf. Written Communications\nTo assure consistency and coordination among various fundraising efforts, final drafts of written communications describing major fundraising initiatives must be shared with the Vice President for Development or designee. Additionally, the Office of Planned Giving must review all agreements of $100,000 or more (and all agreements establishing new endowments) prior to submission to the donor and/or acceptance by the University.\ng. Staffing\nSchool and unit staff and budget plans for fundraising must be reviewed and approved by the Provost. Decisions regarding classification and compensation of development staff rest with the dean/director and the Vice President for Development who share responsibility for assuring that fairness is maintained across the University. In addition, the Vice President for Development must review and approve any requests to hire external fundraising consultants.\nh. Priority Setting Process\nDevelopment priorities will be established in accordance with Guide Memo 4.4.1: Fundraising Approval and Priority-Setting.\ni. Annual Giving\nThe following policies govern annual giving at Stanford:\n(1) Stanford Fund\nThe Stanford Fund exists to provide the President and Provost with sustained, discretionary gift support for undergraduate education and undergraduate student life. All undergraduate degree holders, including those with a Stanford graduate degree, professional school degree, or credits earned toward such degrees, are solicited by the fund. The Stanford Fund also solicits non-degree holders with credits earned toward a Stanford undergraduate degree and parents of current undergraduates and non-alumni (\"friends\") with a prior history of giving to the fund.\n(2) School Funds\nThe school funds may solicit their graduate and professional degree holders, including those who also have an undergraduate degree from Stanford. The school funds are also able to solicit non-undergraduate degree holders with credits earned toward a Stanford graduate or professional degree. Departments and programs may not solicit their graduates. Other solicitable populations include non-alumni (\"friends\") with a prior history of giving to the school and parents of Stanford professional or graduate degree holders.\n(3) Athletics\nThe Department of Athletics may solicit any current or former annual donors to athletics, former student-athletes, and Stanford season ticket holders.\n(4) Medical\nSubject to any applicable restrictions imposed by law, alumni who are treated as patients at Stanford Medical Center may be solicited by medical development."}

The aim of this Guide Memo is to establish a systematic and orderly approach to private funding sources, to maximize support from them, and to assure that support is directed toward University priorities.\nApplicability: These policies apply to all gift procurement activities of the University and/or its schools and units. Gifts are defined in Guide Memo 4.1.1: Gifts to the University.\n1. Policy\nRequests to raise gift funds are subject to review and approval under the procedures set forth in this Guide Memo. The procedure for obtaining clearance to approach and solicit specific prospective donors is set forth in Guide Memo 4.3.1: Operating Policies for Development.\n2. Applicability\na. Applicability\nThe procedures detailed in this Guide Memo apply whenever approval is sought to raise gifts from individuals, foundations, associations or corporations to support a project. Projects are defined broadly to include any program or activity of the University and/or its schools and units. Gifts are defined in Guide Memo 4.1.1: Gifts to the University. These procedures do not apply to the following:\n(1) Certain small projects\nProjects for which the total fundraising requirement over the life of the project is less than $1,000,000 require only decanal or directorial approval if all of the fundraising will be handled within the school or unit by the faculty and/or school's or unit's development staff without assistance sought from the central Office of Development. However, (1) clearance to approach each specific prospect is still required under Guide Memo 4.3.1[2]: Operating Policies for Development; and (2) the proposed gift should be reviewed with central development staff if there are any unusual terms or circumstances relating to a particular gift, such as if the prospect has no prior relationship with Stanford, if the gift is to fund a new program or project or if any of the gift terms are unusual.\n(2) Facilities\nRequests for approval to raise funds for facilities projects are handled as part of the Provost's Capital Plan process. Approval of a facilities project, including new construction and renovation projects, will include a careful consideration of potential funding sources. Facilities projects will be assigned a fundraising priority by the Provost after consultation with the Office of Development about those sources. Clearance to approach each specific prospect is still required under Guide Memo 4.3.1: Operating Policies for Development.\n(3) Sponsored Projects\nPolicy and procedures with respect to the preparation, review, and submission of sponsored project proposals are set forth in the Research Policy Handbook 14.1. Consult Research Policy Handbook Document 13.1 for the distinction between gifts and sponsored projects.\n(4) Industrial Affiliates Programs\nPrinciples, guidelines, and procedures for the establishment and operation of industrial affiliates and related membership-supported programs are set forth in the Research Policy Handbook 13.4. \nb. Specific Requirements for Certain Activities\nGift solicitations for activities involving human subjects, laboratory animals, radiological hazards, biologically infectious agents, or recombinant DNA techniques are also subject to review by the Sponsored Projects Office for compliance with University policies and external requirements.\n3. Application and Review Procedures\na. Request\nThe Requestor initiates the process by completing the on-line Request for Fundraising Approval and Priority Form. Once the Requestor has completed the Form, it is automatically routed to the cognizant Development Officer.\nb. Development Officer Review\nBased on the information provided by the Requestor, the cognizant Development Officer completes the next section of the Form, including an assessment of fundraising feasibility and a recommendation regarding fundraising priority. When the Development Officer has completed the Form, it is automatically routed to the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet Officer.\nc. School Dean/Cognizant Cabinet Officer Review\nBased on the information provided by the Requestor, and the cognizant Development Officer, the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet officer completes the next section of the Form. At this point, the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet officer may (1) approve the Request and provide a recommendation regarding fundraising priority, (2) return the Request and ask for additional information, or (3) deny the Request. If the Request is approved, the Form will be automatically routed to the Office of the Vice President for Development. If the Request is denied or returned for additional information, the Form will be automatically routed back to the Requestor.\nd. Office of the Vice President for Development Review\nBased on the information provided by the Requestor, cognizant Development Officer, and School Dean or cognizant Cabinet Officer, the Vice President for Development (or their designee) completes the next section of the Form, including their own assessment of fundraising feasibility and recommendation regarding fundraising priority. When the Office of the Vice President for Development has completed the Form, it is automatically routed to the Office of the Provost.\ne. Provostial Review\nAfter a Request has been approved by the School Dean or cognizant Cabinet officer, and the Office of the Vice President for Development, and forwarded to the Office of the Provost, the Provost or the Provost's designee, in consultation with such individuals and/or committees as the Provost may designate, will review the Request using the following criteria:\n(1) Academic justification\nHow closely does the project relate to the academic plans of the department, the school, and the University?\n(2) Budgetary impact\nWould funding the project by means of gifts offset existing demands on general funds budgets? Would the project require general funds support, cost sharing, or other immediate financial obligations? Would the project place future financial obligations on the University once the gift or grant funds have expired?\n(3) Fundraising potential\nHow many prospective donors exist for the project and to what extent would it compete with other projects of interest to such donors?\nf. Provostial Decision\nAfter weighing these factors the Provost or the Provost's designee will (1) approve the Request with an assigned priority, (2) return the Request and ask for additional information, or (3) deny the Request. The designation of a priority determines the level of effort expected from the Development staff. Such priority designations will also assure that donors are presented with the University's most important projects.\n(1) Approved with High Priority\nFunds for projects awarded this priority will be actively sought, both by school and unit development staff and by the central Office of Development. The Office of Development will work with school and unit development staff to identify and solicit prospects for high priority projects and will enlist volunteers and faculty support as needed, taking into account other project(s) in which prospects may also be interested. Clearance to approach specific prospects is required under Guide Memo 4.3.1: Operating Policies for Development.\n(2) Approved with Standard Priority\nFundraising for projects with this priority must be in the form of specific proposals to particular prospective donors or on a noncompetitive \"target of opportunity\" basis. Fundraising, including identification and solicitation of prospects, will primarily be handled within the school or unit, subject to clearance of prospect access under Guide Memo 4.3.1: Operating Policies for Development. The central Office of Development may, at the discretion of the Vice President for Development, initiate further activity and provide assistance in identifying additional prospective donors.\n(3) Approved with Minimum Priority\nFundraising projects with this priority must not compete with fundraising for other projects. In most cases, this will mean that fundraising will be limited to corporations and foundations that have an identified programmatic interest in the project, and except in the most unusual cases must not include approaches to alumni, parents, and friends. Fundraising must be handled exclusively by the school or unit, without any assistance from the central Office of Development. As always, clearance to approach any specific prospect is required under Guide Memo 4.3.1: Operating Policies for Development.\n(4) Denied\nNo gifts may be solicited for projects for which fundraising approval has been denied. Requestors may wish to consider other funding sources as outlined in Guide Memo 4.5.1: Funding New Programs.\ng. Development Action\nAfter a project has been approved and assigned a priority, the Provost will send the Request for Fundraising Approval and Priority form describing the project to the Office of the Vice President for Development for distribution to the fundraising staff. At the discretion of the Vice President for Development, a fundraising coordinator for the project may be appointed. The Development Office will periodically review its list of approved and rated projects in order to recommend changes to the Provost based on fundraising results."}
{"url":"https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapters/giving-stanford/receiving-and-processing-gifts/departmental-special-collections","text":"4.2.4 Departmental Special Collections | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 42.3\nOver the years, many Stanford departments have acquired valuable special collections of artifacts, specimens, and historical objects. These departmental acquisitions have reflected the interests of a particular faculty member, concerns growing out of a specific research project or departmental initiative, or the sense that an available collection could enhance the pursuit of an academic discipline. However, such acquisitions carry with them institutional obligations. This Guide Memo provides administrative guidelines to assist departmental managers with such collections.\n1. Planning Policies\na. Cost-Benefit Considerations\nWhen deciding whether to acquire or deaccession1 collections, departments should consider the short- and long-term benefits of the items for research, teaching, and historical significance in relation to the short- and long-term costs of maintaining the collection. Obligations to the donor must be considered and any written restrictions placed on the donated collection by the donor must also be honored in deaccession decisions.\nCosts for personnel; space, security, and environmental needs; preservation; insurance; and use of the collection (for display, loan, research, or teaching aids) should be estimated in relation to departmental priorities for teaching and research as well as the current and prospective availability of funding. These funding estimates should take into account:\nCurrent available monies for personnel, and facilities that could be employed, without increased costs, for the management and protection of the collection\nAdditional monies needed to cover current estimated costs\nProjected changes in costs for the future\nSources of future internal funding\nSources of external support (grants, gifts)\nb. Administrative Structure\nTo facilitate ongoing management, departments should:\nEstablish procedures for periodically reviewing benefits of the collection in relation to its cost\nClarify lines of authority for making decisions to deaccession collections\nEstablish policies on the reuse of funds gained from selling a collection\n1\"Deaccession\" is a technical term used by librarians and museum curators. It means to remove an object permanently from a collection. \n2. Management Policies\na. Responsibility\nWhen a school or department makes a decision to accept as a gift or loan or otherwise develop or acquire a collection of artifacts or other materials, it takes on the responsibility to fund, house, manage, preserve, and, if appropriate, dispose of these items. Before entering into a written agreement with a prospective donor that carries restrictions on the use, care, or disposition of a collection, the school or department may wish to consult with the Office of Planned Giving in the Office of Development and/or the Cantor Arts Center, Libraries and Archives.\nb. Inventory and Control\n(1) Record-keeping\nDepartments should have an inventory system for current and new acquisitions of collections and on-going record-keeping practices for controlling their use and protection. See also Guide Memo 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment, for policies on recording gifts of capital equipment.\n(2) Cataloging\nTo facilitate the use of a departmental collection, departments may want to prepare a catalog, either manual (such as a card catalog) or computerized (such as a data base file).\n(3) Security\nGuide Memo 2.4.5: Protection of Property, outlines departmental responsibilities for safeguarding precious and high value items.\n(4) Control of Access/Facilitation of Use\nDepartments should develop access and lending policies (where applicable), information about the availability and display of the collection, and a system for tracking the collection over time which will serve to increase and facilitate the use of the collection, and at the same time provide appropriate protection and security for the contents. Departments have the discretionary authority to restrict the use of a collection; any such restrictions should be noted in the publicity.\nc. Care of Collections\n(1) Preservation\nCollections should be stored, used, lent out, and displayed in a manner that will minimize the risk of loss, theft and damage (see Guide Memo 2.4.5: Protection of Property. All policies for preservation should be developed to maximize the enhancement of the collections for their present and future use. Policies developed for the preservation of collections in the Cantor Arts Center, the Libraries and Archives can be referred to as useful models in the development of departmental policies.\n(2) Space Allocation and Use\nThe space used to store and display collections should be environmentally appropriate and secure.\n(3) Personnel\nDepartmental collections must be supervised by an assigned individual. When the advice of curators is needed, departments should utilize the expertise of curators in Green Library, the Hoover Archives and the Cantor Arts Center.\n(4) Budget\nFunding for personnel and other costs of the care, display, and use of the collections is a departmental responsibility.\nd. Disposition of Deaccessioned Collections\n(1) Considerations\nDeaccessioned collections must be disposed of in a manner that respects the intentions of the donor and does not diminish the assets of the institution. If there are written restrictions pertaining to the gift they must be honored unless waived by the donor.\n(2) Consultation\nIf necessary, departments should seek legal counsel, including staff counsel in the Office of Development, and independent expert opinion. If possible, they should also inform the donors and/or their heirs of the proposed action. If the collection was a gift, the Office of Development should be notified of the department's plans.\n(3) Means of Disposal\nThe department should develop policies on appropriate means of disposal, such as sale, transfer to another institution, or destruction. Policies developed for the deaccessioning of collections in the Cantor Arts Center, the Libraries and Archives can be referred to as useful models.\n(4) Further Information\nDepartments considering selling a collection should consult Guide Memo 5.2.4: Surplus Property Sales."}
