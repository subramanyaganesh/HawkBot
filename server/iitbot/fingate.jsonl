This program is designed to assist in situations where the emergency may impede \nacademic progress, and for those who cannot reasonably resolve their financial difficulty through fellowships, loans, or \npersonal resources. \nEmergency Grant-in-Aid awards are grants that reimburse actual expenses. These awards are not a loan and do not need to \nbe repaid. Emergency Grant-in-Aid awards are taxable income. \nEligible expenses: Unanticipated or unusual expenses (most commonly medical, dental, or legal, but other expenses can be \nconsidered) outside of the typical student budget that may hinder the student\u2019s academic progress will be considered. \nCosts must have been incurred while enrolled at Stanford, and costs for a previous or future academic year will not be \nconsidered. Each case is considered on its own merits. Any costs that are not documented cannot be considered. \nTemporary COVID-19 Related Funding: Additional Grant-In-Aid funds have been made available to assist graduate \nstudents in this unusual situation. Expenses considered include but are not limited to unexpected travel expenses, \nexpenses related to academic activities performed from home, costs incurred as a result of carrying out essential research \non campus, or accommodation for unexpected changes in family finances. \nEmergency Grant-in-Aid funds are not intended for tuition or fees, for standard living expenses, when another aid has ceased, \nor for research-related expenses. \nAmount: up to $5,000 per academic year (exceptions may be made for those with COVID-19 related expenses) \nStudent eligibility: Students enrolled in any graduate-level degree program in the School of Earth, Energy and \nEnvironmental Sciences; the Graduate School of Education; the School of Engineering; the School of Humanities and \nSciences; and the School of Medicine (non-MD students) are eligible to apply. Students in the Graduate School of Business, \nSchool of Law, and School of Medicine (MD students) may also apply, but know that we will coordinate with your Financial \nAid Office. \nStudents applying for Emergency Grant-in-Aid funds must be making satisfactory academic progress and must be enrolled \nat Stanford University. Exceptions can be made for students on a medical leave of absence. \nApplication Requirements \nSubmit to: Financial Aid Office \nMontag Hall, 355 Galvez Street, or \nFax: (650) 725-0540, or \nSecure Document Upload: https://financialaid.stanford.edu/upload (select \u201cother\u201d document type) \nThe Grant-In-Aid Committee will review your financial aid history and academic record and contact you for additional \ninformation or notify you of the status of your application two to four weeks after the application materials have been \nsubmitted. \nCompleted applications received during the month of August will begin receiving notifications during September. \n1.Completed Application Form \n2.Documentation of Income: Student and spouse\u2019s latest federal income tax return. Not required if the applicant has submitted \na FAFSA. \n3.Documentation of expenses such as copies of billing statements or receipts is required. If requesting aid to cover medical \nor dental costs, invoices or treatment plans from the medical provider are required. Example: Request is for $750 for \nmedical expenses. Submission might include: \n\uf0b7 Invoice for $25 copay and treatment plan stating 10 visits are needed. ($25x10 visits= $250) \n\uf0b7 Receipts/prescriptions for $50 worth of medication, with a statement that this represents one week of a 10 week \ntreatment.

Stanford will send eligible employees the IRS Form 1095-C notification of coverage by the beginning of March. The Form 1095-C will be sent by U.S. Mail unless you are a benefits-eligible employee and select electronic delivery by Jan. 1.\nLog into ACA 1095 Portal and elect e-delivery\n1095 FORMSWHO YOU\u2019LL RECEIVE IT FROMWHAT TO DO WITH IT\n1095-A Provided by the Health Insurance Marketplace if you were enrolled in a Marketplace plan during the tax year.\tUse it to complete your U.S. Individual Tax Return and other forms. It is your \"proof of coverage\" for the ACA Individual Mandate. You are not required to submit it to the IRS with your tax filing. The Marketplace plan will file it with the IRS. You should keep it with your other important tax documents.\t\n1095-B Provided by non-Marketplace health plan insurers (e.g. Kaiser) if you were enrolled in a fully insured medical plan during the tax year or if you were enrolled in an employer self funded plan but were not employed by that employer in the tax year.\tUse it to complete your U.S. Individual Tax Return and other forms.

Some hosting \narrangement examples are software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). \n2 Hosting arrangement is defined as follows: \na) Timing: \n3 Capitalization \nUpgrades and enhancements are defined as modifications to existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality - \nthat is, modifications to enable the software to perform tasks that it was previously incapable of performing. Upgrades and \nenhancements normally require new software specifications and may also require a change to all or part of the existing software \nspecifications. \n4 \nGeneral and administrative costs include the following examples: space/rent, utilities, telephone, overhead costs, supplies and \nequipment. \n5 \n\"Without significant penalty\" contains two distinct concepts: (i) The ability to take delivery of the software without \nincurring significant cost and (ii) The ability to use the software separately without a significant diminution in utility or value. \nb) Multiple elements: \nThe purchase price of the software may include multiple elements, such as training for the software, maintenance fees \nfor routine maintenance work to be performed by the third party, data conversion costs, re-engineering costs, and rights \nto future upgrades and enhancements. In such case, the department who enters into this arrangement shall allocate the \ncost among all individual elements. The allocation shall be based on objective evidence of fair value of the elements in \nthe contract, not necessarily separate prices stated within the contract for each element. \nBegin capitalization when: \n1) Completed Preliminary Project Stage \n2) Funding has been approved \n3) Probable that: Project will be completed AND software functionality conforms to intent \nEnd Capitalization when: Project substantially completed AND ready for internal use (Usually is the Go-Live date) \nThe capitalized software may have a potential impairment in value that warrants it being written down/off if any of the \nfollowing occur: \nc) Potential impairment in the value of capitalized cost: \n1) The acquired or developed software is not expected to provide substantive service potential \n2) A significant change occurs in the extent or manner in which the software was intended to be used \n3) A significant change is made or will be made to the software program \n4) The costs of developing or modifying the software significantly exceeded the original expected amount \npage 2 of 2 \nFor SGG projects, even if the software selection process is not complete, this Form should be filled out and submitted with the \nproject charter to Business Affairs Finance and Facilities.

Expense reports are used to report business and travel expenses (including Travel Card and receipt-based expenses) for the purpose of expense approval and the allocation of expenses to the appropriate project, task, award and expenditure type (PTAE). An expense report may also result in a reimbursement to the payee for eligible out-of-pocket expenses. \nFor Domestic SU Payees\nBefore You Start\nLearn about creating an SU Payee Expense Report, by taking the STARS Course, FIN-0500 Introduction to the Expense Requests System and view the screenshots in FIN-0500: Learning Supplements.\nFor details on using Expense Reports to manage Travel Card Expenses, review the STARS Course, FIN-0402: Expense Reports with Travel Card Transactions and/or view the Learning Supplements, Expense Reports with Travel Card Transactions Task Demonstrations. \nAll expenses for a trip or that pertain to a single business purpose should be included in one expense report.\nCollect all receipts for a trip or that pertain to one business purpose, organize them by TCard or Cash and by expense type, then scan and save them by individual expense type on the computer desktop. Upload the files as soon as the expense report is ready to submit. Faxing receipts and supporting documents is available, if necessary. \nCreate individual files for all airfare, conference registration and lodging receipts, as these will need to be attached individually to the corresponding line in the expense report.\nAll other receipts and supporting documents can be scanned into a single file, if desired.\nIf an expense has been pre-approved, obtain supporting documentation from the Pre-Approver (which must be attached to the transaction), and add the Pre-Approver to the Approver Routing List.\nLog in to Oracle Financials\nEnter ofweb.stanford.edu in the browser\nSelect Login\nAs prompted, log in using SUNet ID and password\nAccess Expense Requests\nSelect SU Expense Requests\nSelect Transaction Type and Category\nSelect SU Payee under Expense Report in the Create New Transaction column\nSelect Expenses (Domestic U.S.) from the Category drop-down list \nRefer to Guidelines for Use of Expense Report Categories\nEnter General Information\nEnter the Payee's name (Last name, First name) or search and select the payee by selecting the search icon (magnifying glass) The payee must be the employee or student who incurred the expenses, and who will receive a reimbursement if one is owed.\nSelect Yes or No in the Rush Processing drop-down menu\nSelect preferred Payment Method from the drop-down if both electronic and check options are available for a payee (as for some DAPER staff) \nThe payment method is auto-filled based upon what the Stanford payee has setup (electronic or check) with Payroll.\nWill Call Check\nWill Call check delivery option is handled via Rush Processing.\n\n1.

The Fingate page Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions describes tools and reports within Oracle Financials that preparers, approvers, or finance staff can access to monitor aging credit card transactions and to look up or view transactions. The page includes a chart on how to find aging transactions based on role. To find and take action on force cleared PCard or Travel Card transactions, use the OBI Credit Card Transactions Report."}

If your VSR fees are being paid by Stanford, you will need an SSN to file taxes.\nJ-2 Dependents\nThe SSN application is now part of the EAD application.

These sections cover accounting for University fund balances and reconciling and attesting to expenditure statements for sponsored projects, respectively.\n1. Reconciliation Purpose\nAccount balance reconciliations provide reasonable assurance that account balances on the University\u2019s Statement of Financial Position are accurate, complete and valid. Together the account balance reconciliations and account balance attestations are key internal controls that provide reasonable assurance around the following financial statement assertions:\nAccuracy: Transactions were accurately recorded at appropriate amounts.\nCompleteness: All assets, liabilities and net asset balances that should have been recorded were correctly recorded on the Statement of Financial Position.\nExistence: All assets, liabilities and net asset balances that were recorded on the Statement of Financial Position existed at the end of the financial period.\n2. Definitions\nA. Statement of Financial Position\nThe Statement of Financial Position is a financial statement that reports the balances of the University\u2019s assets, liabilities and net assets at a point in time. The Statement of Financial Position is also known as a Balance Sheet. Additional information about the Statement for Financial Position is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nB. Account Balance\nAn account balance on the Statement of Financial Position represents the balance of an asset or liability at a point in time, such as at the end of a month, quarter or year. \nThe University\u2019s assets on the Statement of Financial Position represent resources owned or used by the University and include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, inventory, pledges receivable, loans receivable, investments, and plant facilities. Assets are designated with a 1XXXX series object code or expenditure type in the University\u2019s Chart of Accounts. Assets typically have a debit (positive) balance.\nThe University\u2019s liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position represent debt or obligations to others and include accounts payable, accrued expenses, liabilities associated with investments, notes and bonds payable, and U.S. government refundable loan funds. Liabilities are designated with a 2XXXX series object code or expenditure type in the University\u2019s Chart of Accounts. Liabilities typically have a credit (negative) balance.\nC. Account Balance Reconciliation\nAn account balance reconciliation is the comparison of one or more asset or liability account balances in the general ledger to another, often independent or more detailed source of financial data, such as a bank statement, a subledger or another system. The differences between the account balance and the other source of financial data are reconciling items. Reconciling items may be caused by timing differences or errors, such as general ledger errors, bank errors, or subledger system errors that should be resolved in a timely manner.\n3. Responsibility for Reconciliations\nA. Reconciliation Preparation and Review\nAt least quarterly, each University department with an asset or liability account balance in the general ledger is responsible for designating individuals who are responsible for reconciling and reviewing those balances on all ledgers (typically within 30 days of general ledger close).\nMultiple account balances that are of a similar nature may be reconciled together in one reconciliation, as needed. For some object codes there may be multiple account balances that are the responsibility of different departments. Each department is individually responsible for reconciling its respective balance.\nIn addition to quarterly reconciliations, some account balances must be reconciled and reviewed monthly. The University Controller\u2019s Office designates reconciliation frequency for account balances based on multiple factors including risk, materiality and history.\nIndividuals responsible for reconciling and reviewing cash accounts should also refer to Guide Memo 3.6.1: Bank Accounts and the Office of the Treasurer\u2019s website for additional guidance on bank reconciliations.\nEach University department with an account balance on the Statement of Financial Position is responsible for:\ndeveloping and maintaining desk procedures for account balance reconciliations.\nensuring that account balance reconciliations contain adequate supporting documentation.\nensuring that reconciling items are resolved in a timely manner. \nAccount balance reconciliation best practices and other resources are available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nB. Correction of Transactional Errors\nIf transactional errors are discovered during the account reconciliation, the department is responsible for their correction.\nInformation about how to correct miscoded transactions is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nC. Compliance with Policies and Procedures\nUniversity departments are responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate reconciliation procedures, including reconciliation approval and segregation of duties. Refer to section d. Reconciliation Roles below for additional information about reconciliation segregation of duties.\nUniversity departments are responsible for adhering to department-specific reconciliation policies and procedures. It is recommended that University departments annually review all department-specific reconciliation policies and procedures for accuracy and validity.\nUniversity departments are responsible for adhering to all University policies and procedures during the reconciliation process. This includes but is not limited to adherence to University policies and procedures regarding:\nStewardship of University resources (see section 6 Financial Responsibilities and Internal Controls in Guide Memo 1.1.1.: University Code of Conduct)\nRecord retention of approved reconciliations for future review by the University\u2019s external auditors, internal auditors or the University Controller\u2019s Office (see Guide Memo 3.1.5: Retention of Financial Records)\nObtaining required transaction approvals (see the Financial Authority section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website)\nProcessing and approving Accounts Payable transactions in Oracle (see Guide Memo 5.3 Purchasing and Payments)\nProcessing and approving iJournals (see the Funds Management / About iJournals section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website)\nReporting alleged financial irregularities (see Guide Memo 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities)\nD. Reconciliation Roles\nUniversity departments are responsible for establishing appropriate segregation of duties for account balance reconciliations. Segregation of duties is an internal control that helps safeguard University resources by separating responsibility for a task. The same individual should not prepare and also review a reconciliation. Additionally, University departments are responsible for segregating the reconciliation preparation and activity recording duties. The same individual should not record transactional activity and also reconcile the account balance.\nReconciliation preparation and approval should only be performed by individuals with knowledge of the account balance and an understanding of the reconciliation purpose. Reconciliation reviewers are responsible for ensuring that reconciliation preparers are adequately trained and possess the skill, experience and competence for preparing the reconciliation.\nReconciliation responsibilities are designated by role in the Reconciliation Roles and Responsibilities Matrix in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n4. Reconciliation Review\nThe University Controller\u2019s Office periodically conducts independent reviews of account balance reconciliations. It is expected that reconciliations will be completed prior to the date of request (typically within 30 days of general ledger close) and provided to the Controller\u2019s Office upon request as needed during an audit or other financial statement review. Information about the Reconciliation Review Program is available in the Balance Sheet Account Reconciliations section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/policy/administrative-guide-policy-215-compensation-staff-employees", "text": "2.1.5 Compensation of Staff Employees\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.4\nThis Guide Memo outlines Stanford University's compensation policies.\nApplicability:\nApplies to regular employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and Academic Staff-Libraries as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining for details. This policy also applies to:\nTemporary and casual employees, where specified\nSLAC, but implementation procedures may differ\nPolicy Statement:\nIt is Stanford University's policy to pay salaries that reflect the duties and responsibilities of the position and the scope and complexity of the work performed. This policy and Stanford\u2019s compensation practices are designed to set pay that is competitive in the geographic region where work is performed and ensure that pay is managed in a consistent, equitable manner regardless of funding sources. It is also the intention of the university to set salary ranges that provide competitive pay comparable with relevant labor markets. Consistent with its obligations under the law, Stanford shall not discharge, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against, employees or applicants because they have discussed, inquired about, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant. For questions or further information, contact your local Human Resources office or University Human Resources Staff Compensation.\n1. Information Sources\nUniversity compensation policies and procedures for staff employees are described in this Guide Memo and these publications and memoranda:\nAnnual memoranda that describe the salary program, issued by the Vice President for Human Resources. These memoranda include current compensation policies and procedures, and salary structures that are reviewed and approved each year.\nTo find specific administrative information on the staff compensation program, policies, and salary structures, see the Compensation website.\n2. Hours of Work and Work Records\na. Workweek\nThe basic full-time workweek is 40 hours of work on five consecutive eight-hour days. The standard week is a seven-day period commencing at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ending at midnight the following Sunday. Salaried staff employed for a work week of less than the basic 40-hour week receive reduced salary based on the ratio of hours worked to 40 hours. Staff employees who are employed at an hourly rate are paid for the actual time worked.\nStraight time is time worked up to eight hours a day and 40 hours a week unless the employee is on an alternative work schedule (see section 6, Alternative Work Schedule).\nb. Nonstandard Workweek\nDepartments may establish other workweek schedules or work arrangements to meet their requirements, including a workweek that begins and ends on other days or hours than the basic workweek (outlined in section 3.a), if approved in advance by the local Human Resources office. See guidelines at Flexible Work Options.\nc. Make-Up Time\nAt the written request of the employee, and with the approval of the supervisor, a non-exempt employee may reduce their work hours for a personal obligation on one day and make up the hours not worked on another day during the same workweek. The employee may do this by working more than eight hours but not more than 11 hours in one day, with the understanding that no overtime premium will be paid unless the total number of hours worked in any one day exceeds 11 hours or the total number of hours worked in any one workweek exceeds 40.\nd. Day of Rest\nNon-exempt employees working more than 30 hours a week are entitled to have at least one day off in seven in compliance with California state law.\ne. Rest Breaks\nThe university provides non-exempt employees a 15-minute paid, duty-free rest break for each four hours of work or \"major fraction\" of four hours of work (i.e., more than two hours), provided the employees work at least three-and-one-half hours per day. Insofar as practicable, rest breaks should be scheduled in the middle of each work period. Rest breaks are duty-free time and employees are free to leave the premises, where practicable. Rest breaks should also be arranged so that disruptions of work and services are held to a minimum. Employees are not permitted to use their rest breaks to shorten the workday or to extend the meal period. If a non-exempt employee is not provided the required number of duty-free rest breaks in a day and/or is not relieved of all duty during their rest breaks, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate must be paid to the employee.\nf. Meal Periods\nMeal periods normally are for one hour and are unpaid. Time taken for meal periods is not part of the work day, provided the employee is relieved of all duty. A non-exempt employee must be provided with an unpaid meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than five hours of work, and a second meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than ten hours of work, unless the employee waives the right to the second meal period. A non-exempt employee who works no more than six hours in the workday may also waive the right to a meal period if the supervisor approves. Such waivers require the employee\u2019s consent, can be revoked by the employee at any time, and are recommended to be in writing. Supervisors should consult with their local Human Resources office before agreeing to waive an employee\u2019s meal period.\nIf a non-exempt employee is not provided with a 30-minute, duty-free meal period and/or is not relieved of all duty during a meal period, then the time must be recorded as work hours. Additionally, a penalty of one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate must be paid to the employee for any missed, late, or otherwise non-compliant meal period.\ng. Note to Supervisors\nUnpaid meal breaks, including actual start and stop times, must be recorded in each employee's Axess Timecard. If a meal break is not provided, a one-hour penalty must also be recorded.\nh. Work Records\n1. Records for Non-Exempt Employees\nFederal and state laws require non-exempt employees to keep an accurate daily record of hours actually worked, including actual start and stop times and meal breaks. Axess Timecard, in the human resources management system (HRMS) is the system of record to indicate hours worked, including overtime hours and vacation, sick, holiday and other leave time taken by each non-exempt employee. In the time-keeping system, records must be updated by the end of each pay period, but it is recommended that employees update their actual work hours each work day. Supervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve non-exempt employees' time records and must approve any variance from the employees' normally scheduled work hours.\nAlso see Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations, Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time, Guide Memo 2.1.8: Miscellaneous Authorized Absences, and Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays.\n2. Records for Exempt Employees\nAxess Timecard, in the human resources management system (HRMS), is the system of record to indicate vacation, sick and other leave time taken by each regular exempt employee. In that system, records must be updated by the end of each pay period. For exempt employees it is not necessary to report any vacation, PTO or Floating Holiday time less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours. Sick time may be taken in any increment. In the case of intermittent Family and Medical Leave, the local Human Resources office must be consulted to ensure that (a) accurate records are maintained of time used for Family and Medical Leave, and (b) the employee's leave balance is properly reduced for time charged to intermittent Family and Medical Leave. Supervisors (or their departmental designees) must approve exempt employees' leave records.\nAlso see Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations, Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time, Guide Memo 2.1.8: Miscellaneous Authorized Absences and Guide Memo 2.1.13: Paid Holidays.\n3. Records for Non-Employees\nStanford is not required to keep a record of hours for consultants or employees of another employer with whom the university has a contract for service.\n3. Pay Administration\nThe Vice President for Human Resources administers the overall salary program, including establishing staff job classifications, maintaining location-based salary structures, and developing job-specific regional market pay ranges. University Human Resources Staff Compensation is responsible for providing guidance to local Human Resource Managers to ensure jobs are properly classified, and base pay is set appropriately and managed in a consistent, equitable manner. University Human Resources Staff Compensation proactively reviews and approves all pay actions for Remote employees to ensure pay is managed in alignment with the applicable salary structure and program guidelines, and is equitable with pay of Stanford employees in similar roles. The Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts, Deans and Directors are responsible for managing pay and classification actions in their area(s) in a manner consistent with this policy and compensation program guidelines. \na. Base Pay\nBase pay is set for each job based on market survey data and managed within the parameters established by the applicable salary structure. Pay for employees in On-site and Hybrid work arrangements and Remote employees who perform work within the 10-county area is set and managed based on the Stanford Work Location Salary Structure. Pay for remote employees who perform work working outside the 10-county area is set and managed based on one of the four Regional Salary Structures determined by the location where work is performed. See Guide Memo 2.1.21 for definitions of On-site, Hybrid, Remote, and 10-county area. Upon request to their supervisor or local Human Resources Manager, employees will be provided the pay range for their current position.\nb. Minimum Wage\nIn compliance with federal and state laws, employees must be paid the current minimum wage or higher unless a request for a specific exception is allowable under the law and approved by the Vice President for Human Resources. Information on the current minimum wage rate is available from University Human Resources Staff Compensation.\nc. Non-Cash Compensation\nWhen the university provides perquisites such as room, apartment, or meals, their value (as determined under tax laws) is added to cash compensation (and the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay if required by law) to establish total base pay for computation of insured benefits. When required to be taken as a condition of employment, perquisites are not subject to federal income tax.\nd. Performance Increases\nStaff employees are eligible for pay increases based on performance. Pay increases are not automatic. Internal pay relationships and relevant market information are considered in setting pay increases.\n4. Overtime Compensation\na. Employees Exempt from Overtime Compensation\n(1) Definition of Exempt Employee\nCertain employees hold jobs that are exempt from governmental regulations regarding compensation for overtime work. In general, employees are exempt when employed in executive, administrative or learned, creative or computer professional positions as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act and California law. Exempt University employees are not entitled to receive overtime pay.\nThe Vice President for Human Resources or designee determines the exempt or non-exempt status of university classifications. Special circumstances, such as an employee working in more than one job (also referred to as a dual appointment) that may affect their exempt status, must be discussed with the local Human Resources office before hiring employees into additional jobs.\nNormal Expectations - Because of the many activities required to keep the university functioning, full-time members of the academic staff and regular exempt staff may be called upon to perform a variety of services for the institution apart from those normally considered to be their regular job duties. These staff members may be assigned these tasks either within their department or for another area within the university.\nFurther, it is understood that regular academic and exempt staff may often be expected to work in excess of 40 hours a week. Because these situations are considered to fall within the normal expectations for these staff, they would not constitute grounds for payment of additional compensation and the staff member would not receive payment in excess of 100% of the FTE salary.\nIf an employee receives a request to perform additional work for a department other than the employee's home department assignment (whether related or unrelated to the employee's current responsibilities), the employee must receive formal approval in advance from their supervisor or provide notification to the supervisor, depending on the duties:\nFor non-teaching duties, the employee must receive prior written approval from their current supervisor and the local Human Resources Office.\nFor teaching duties: \nIf the teaching duties occur outside the employee's normal work schedule, the employee must give prior written notification to their current supervisor and the local Human Resources office.\nIf preparation and/or teaching duties occur during the employee's normal work schedule, the employee must receive prior written approval from their current supervisor and the local Human Resources Office.\n(2) Further Information\nFor regular non-bargaining unit staff and academic staff-libraries, contact your Human Resources office.\nb. Overtime Entitlement\nAny employee holding a non-exempt job and who is required to work more than eight hours in a day, or more than 40 hours in a week, is entitled to compensation in accordance with (1) below. The total hours worked for one or more departments of the university are to be counted in determining overtime even though employment in any one department does not exceed the standard 8-hour day or 40-hour week. University policy provides for overtime payment for hours worked in excess of eight in one day in accordance with state regulations. University policy provides overtime payment for hours worked in excess of 40 in one week in accordance with state and federal regulations. Overtime policies are applicable to non-exempt temporary and/or casual employees as well as to regular non-exempt employees. University requirements and government regulations require that overtime hours worked by non-exempt employees be recorded and compensated.\n(1) Overtime Rate\nThe university's policy is to compensate non-exempt employees at a premium rate of one-and-one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay. For non-exempt employees, the regular rate is the weekly salary, including any applicable premiums required to be added by law, divided by regular, non-overtime hours worked. For non-exempt employees who are paid more than one hourly rate in a pay period, the overtime rate will be calculated based on the weighted average method. \nNon-exempt employees who work in excess of 12 hours per workday or in excess of eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a single work week will be compensated for those excess hours at the rate of twice their regular rate of pay.\nOvertime Rates: \nTime and one-half: hours eight through 12 in one workday\nDouble-time: hours after 12 in one workday\nTime and one-half: first eight hours on seventh consecutive workday\nDouble-time: after eight hours on seventh consecutive workday\nTime and one-half: after 40 hours in one work week, unless a double-time premium applies\n(2) Overtime Hours\nAuthorized paid time off (e.g., vacation, sick leave, personal time off, holidays, etc.) counts as time worked in determining if a non-exempt employee is entitled to overtime compensation. Leave without pay does not count as time worked.\n(3) Overtime Limitations\nOvertime work is to be kept to a minimum because of costs. Departments should permit overtime work by non-exempt employees only when it is essential to the operation of the department. State law prohibits persons under age 18 from working more than eight hours per day under any circumstances.\n(4) Approval of Overtime Work\nOvertime work by non-exempt employees requires approval in advance by the department head or a designated representative who has the authority to schedule work and approve overtime compensation. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to schedule or approve overtime work for themselves. Non-exempt employees cannot be authorized to work unpaid overtime. In circumstances where a part-time employee plans to work in more than one job for the same or other department(s), the employee\u2019s supervisors should contact the local Human Resources office for consultation on both topics before implementation. In the event an employee works overtime without obtaining the prior approval of their supervisor, the overtime hours must be paid, but the failure of the employee to follow this provision can be addressed through corrective action.\n(5) Approval of Extended Overtime\nDepartments finding it necessary to schedule overtime for one or more employees on a regular basis for six months or longer as the only means of meeting work requirements, must obtain approval in advance from the appropriate Vice President or Vice Provost.\n5. Alternative Work Schedule\na. Definition\n\"Alternative work week\" refers to a schedule that allows non-exempt employees to work a standard work week (40 hours) that is condensed into fewer than five full days. A common alternative work week schedule is four 10-hour days.\nb. Guidelines\nGuidelines for Flexible Work Options.\nc. Administrative Considerations\nManagers should consider their operational needs before implementing an alternative work schedule. For example, an alternative work schedule may be used in the academic departments where expanded service hours are needed to accommodate client needs during irregular hours (e.g., students or clients in other time zones), but may be impractical when 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. coverage is the priority.\nd. Alternative Work Schedule Election\nUpon secret ballot election by affected employees conducted in strict compliance with applicable laws, and with the concurrence of management, non-exempt employees may work an \"alternative work week,\" such as four 10-hour work days, with the understanding that no overtime premium will be due unless the employee works more than 40 hours in any one week, or the supervisor compels the employee to work more than the agreed upon hours in any work day. No alternative work schedule for non-exempt employees may be implemented unless it meets all legal requirements and prerequisites and is reviewed in advance by Employee & Labor Relations in University Human Resources. Contact your local Human Resources office if you are interested in exploring the option of implementing an alternative work schedule, or consult with Employee & Labor Relations and review these guidelines for alternative work schedules or flexible work options.\n6. Special Compensation Situations for Non-Exempt Employees\na. Call-Back Time\n\"Call-back\" time occurs when a non-exempt employee responds to an emergency call and returns to work outside their normal working hours without advance notice. The minimum compensation for \"call-back\" time is two hours pay. Compensation for \"call-back\" time includes all hours worked, including the actual time spent traveling to and from the \"call-back\" duty.\nb. Standby and Beeper Pay\nEmployees away from work may be required to remain accessible for consultation or to return to work. Non-exempt employees assigned such duties are eligible to receive partial salary for the duration of the assignment depending on the extent to which that assignment restricts their personal activities.\n(1) Beeper Pay\nIf that restriction is limited to carrying a \"beeper,\" cell phone or similar device, and remain within range of the device, and be required to return any beeper page or call within 20 minutes, the partial salary is 5% of the employee's base pay for hours assigned to beeper duty, but not at work (called \"beeper pay\"). Any time spent by the employee answering pages or calls or returning to work is compensable at the employee\u2019s base rate of pay or overtime regular rate, as applicable.\n(2) Standby Pay\nIf the restriction is narrower than discussed in (1) above, and the assignment requires the employee to be prepared to return instantly to return to work, the partial salary is 50% of the employee's base pay (which must be at least the minimum wage) for hours assigned to standby duty, but not at work (called \"standby pay\"). \nc. Shift Pay\nShift premiums are paid to non-exempt full-time employees assigned to shifts other than daytime schedules. Non-exempt employees working full-time and assigned to swing shifts (shifts starting between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m.) will be paid a 10% shift premium. Non-exempt employees working full-time and assigned to owl/night shifts (shifts starting between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.) will be paid a 15% shift premium. \nNon-exempt employees who work swing shifts or owl/night shifts for their own convenience rather than to meet operational needs shall be considered to be assigned to daytime schedules and paid their normal hourly rate regardless of when the hours are actually worked.\nThis shift pay provision does not apply to sworn officers in the Department of Public Safety.\n7. Temporary Compensation for Work in a Higher Classification\nAdditional temporary compensation may be appropriate when an employee temporarily fills a position at a higher classification for two or more consecutive months, but typically no longer than six months, subject to additional considerations. The employee retains their classification and exempt or non-exempt status during the temporary assignment. In addition, non-exempt employees may be entitled to overtime compensation consistent with the sections in this Guide Memo. For questions or further information or assistance in determining the appropriate temporary compensation amount, contact University Human Resources, Staff Compensation."}

For policies that apply to staff employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the agreements between Stanford University and SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and Stanford University and the Stanford Deputy Sheriffs' Association. Agreements can be found at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. Procedures for SLAC employees may vary. Contingent staff employees do not accrue vacation (see Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, Section 7.b.).\n1. Accrual of Vacation\na. \"Period of Service\" for the Purpose of Determining Vacation Accrual Rates\n\"Period of service\" for the purpose of determining vacation accrual rates means the years of service counted from the employee's initial hire date as a \"regular staff employee,\" as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. Months that count as service are:\nthose for which some pay is received, and\nthose following layoff when rehire occurs within 24 months.\nb. Accrual Rate Change Dates\nChanges in vacation rate accruals (both increases and decreases) are effective on the first day of the employee's anniversary or status change month. The accrual change is credited in the system by the last day of that month.\nc. Vacation Accrual Amounts\n(1) For Full-time Employment\nVacation leave accrues according to the following tables:\nVacation Leave Accruals, Non-exempt Staff\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt StaffPer Hour on Straight Time Pay StatusApproximate Days Accrued per Year\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt Staff During first year\tPer Hour on Straight Time Pay Status 0.057700\tApproximate Days Accrued per Year 15\t\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt Staff Beginning year 2 through end of year 9\tPer Hour on Straight Time Pay Status 0.07693\tApproximate Days Accrued per Year 20\t\nQualifying Service Non-Exempt Staff Beginning year 10 and thereafter\tPer Hour on Straight Time Pay Status 0.092310\tApproximate Days Accrued per Year 24\t\nVacation Leave Accruals, Exempt Staff\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked)Hours per Calendar MonthApproximate Days per Year\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked) During first year\tHours per Calendar Month 10\tApproximate Days per Year 15\t\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked) Beginning year 2 through end of year 9\tHours per Calendar Month 13.33\tApproximate Days per Year 20\t\nYears of ServiceExempt Staff (Do not track hours worked) Beginning year 10 and thereafter\tHours per Calendar Month 16\tApproximate Days per Year 24\t\n(2) For Part-time and Part-month Employment\nVacation is credited on a prorated basis for all hours in straight time pay status (not overtime) in the month credited. \"Straight-time pay\" for the purpose of vacation accrual includes both straight-time pay for work performed and pay for holidays, vacation, and sick time. (For more information, see Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees.) Accrual for exempt employees is prorated based on the proportion of the employee's FTE.\nd. Method of Accruing Vacation\n(1) Vacation Does Accrue\nVacation accrues from the first month of employment during non-overtime periods of work, sick time, and vacation. During seasonal layoff, vacation accrues as if the employee were continuing to work regular time. Vacation is credited at the end of each month of service.\n(2) Vacation Does Not Accrue\nNo vacation accrues:\nDuring any period of terminal vacation, pursuant to section 2.g.(2).\nDuring periods of leave with or without pay, including periods of short-term disability, long-term disability, Workers' Compensation, or when using Family Temporary Disability wage replacement (FTD).\ne. Maximum Vacation Accumulation\n(1) Accrual Limits\nUnused vacation accumulates from year to year, but the maximum amount of vacation that a full time employee can accrue is 240 hours (30 work days). If an employee has accrued the maximum, vacation ceases to accrue. Vacation time will again accrue after the employee uses vacation time and the balance falls below 240 hours. The employee is not credited any vacation not earned due to having reached the 240 hour accrual maximum. New accruals will not exceed the 240 hour maximum.\n(2) Accrual Limits for Part-time Employment\nThe maximum allowable accrual is prorated based on the eligible employee's FTE.\n(3) Approval for Exceptions\nAny exception to the maximum allowable accrual must be requested in writing in advance by the employee's department, must identify the unique operational requirements that warrant the exception, and must be directed to the Vice President for Human Resources. Only the Vice President for Human Resources may grant an exception to the accrual maximum.\n(4) Change in Status\nWhen an employee's change in status from full-time to part-time results in an employee's vacation accumulation exceeding the employee's new maximum, the employee is paid for the excess at the time of the status change unless the employee and the employee's department mutually agree upon arrangements for the excess to be taken within a short period of time. Such arrangements can provide for a combination of payment and vacation. Payment is based on the pay rate that was in effect immediately before the status change.\n2. Use of Vacation\na. No Advance on Vacation\nEmployees may not use vacation before it has been credited, except for borrowing up to the amount the employee would normally accrue in one month to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid during Winter Closure.\nb. Scheduling of Vacations\nDepartments are responsible for providing opportunities for employees to take vacations each year. Vacation should normally be taken in the fiscal year when it is accrued. Specific arrangements are subject to supervisory approval and scheduling compatible with depart-mental operational needs, and should consider the employee's preferences. If an employee has not scheduled vacation, they may be required to use accrued vacation time before the close of the fiscal year in which it was accrued, or before the close of a grant or contract that supports the employee's salary.\nc. Reporting Vacation Time\nNon-Exempt Employees - Record all vacation time taken during a pay period in the human resources management system (HRMS).\nExempt Employees - Vacation time is generally not reported in increments of less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours.\nd. Use of Vacation for Non-vacation Absences\nVacation accruals can be used for other absences (e.g., disability, personal, Winter Closure) when requested by the employee and approved by the supervisor.\ne. Advance Pay for Vacations\nSee Guide Memo 2.2.3: University Payroll.\nf. Pay in Lieu of Vacation\nVacation accruals cannot be converted to cash except when employment terminates or when a change in employment status results in an employee's accumulation exceeding the maximum allowable (see 1.e.(1) above).\ng. Vacation Payment upon Termination\n(1) Lump Sum Payment\nAt the termination of their regular staff employment with Stanford University, employees receive a lump sum payment at their current rate of pay for their accrued vacation and any unused PTO time and Floating Holiday hours.\n(2) Terminal Vacation\nTerminal vacation is a benefit the university offers to employees who are retiring pursuant to Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement or being laid off, in which the affected employee may elect to use their accrued vacation, unused PTO, and Floating Holiday hours in the period immediately following the employee's last day of active work. The time is used at the work commitment level held at retirement or layoff (e.g., a full-time employee will use 8 hours per day) to remain on the payroll. Any remaining accruals that are less than a full day are paid out to the employee on the last full day of terminal vacation.\nEligibility: Only employees who are retiring or being permanently laid off may elect to use unused Vacation accruals, Floating Holiday time and PTO hours after the last day of actual work. Employees who are being permanently laid off and are given pay in lieu of notice are not eligible for terminal vacation and will be paid their accrued and unused Vacation, Floating Holiday and PTO hours on their last day of employment. Employees who are involuntarily terminated but who may qualify to retire under Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement are also not eligible for terminal vacation.\nNotice: A laid off employee must submit to the local Human Resources office written notice of their election to use accumulated hours in the form of terminal vacation within seven (7) calendar days of receiving notice of layoff. A retiring employee must submit to the local Human Resources office written notice of their election to use accumulated hours in the form of terminal vacation at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the last day of active work.\nAdditional Employment: While an employee is receiving terminal vacation pay, they cannot be employed in any other Stanford University position.\nEffect of Terminal Vacation: If the laid off employee elects to take terminal vacation, the new layoff effective date or retirement effective date will be the last day of the terminal vacation period. The severance repayment period and the laid off employee\u2019s bridge period begins on the following business day. \nh. Leaves of Absence\nAn approved leave of absence without pay is not a termination of employment and lump-sum payment of accumulated vacation is not provided when an employee takes leave without pay.\ni. Changing Positions\nWhen an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their accumulated vacation accruals. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding vacation time, including policies regarding vacation time use and limits on vacation time accruals.\nj. Fixed-Term Appointees and Employees on Fixed Funding\nEmployees on fixed-term appointments and regular staff employees paid from fixed funding sources may be required to use all accrued vacation before the end of the fixed-term appointment period or the expiration of the funding source.\nk. Non-exempt Employees Working Premium Shifts\nEmployees who regularly work swing or owl/night shifts (see Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees, Section 7.c) and thus normally receive shift premium pay continue to receive shift premium pay for hours charged to vacation leave.\n3. Guide to Supervisors\na. Records and Reports of Vacation\nEmployees must update leave records at the end of each pay period. When an employee terminates, refer to the Human Resources Management System job aids and look in the Termination section. To compute the monetary value of vacation, see How to: Calculate Vacation Accrual. For more information, see Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees.\nb. Reporting Vacation Accumulation to Employees\nEmployees can view their vacation accrual amounts in Axess or on their pay statements."}

For purposes of this Guide Memo, all these types of employees will be referred to as \"regular staff employee(s).\"\nFor policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. Procedures for SLAC employees may vary.\n1. Accrual\na. Eligibility\nRegular staff employees of the University delineated in the Applicability section above accrue and use sick time as described below.\nb. Accrual of Sick Time\nRegular staff employees accrue sick time as follows:\nExempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of 8 hours per month of full-time pay.\nNon-exempt regular staff employees accrue sick time at the rate of .046154 hours per hour of straight time. This equates to 96 hours or 12 days a year in an average year of 2,080 straight time hours.\nFor part-time and part-month employment, sick time is credited on a prorated basis for any month a regular staff employee receives any straight-time pay. Straight-time pay for this purpose includes both straight-time pay for work performed and pay for holidays, vacation and sick. Accrual for an exempt regular staff employee who is employed part-time or part-month is based on the proportion of the regular staff employee with 100% FTE.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year-to-year, with no maximum limit.\nWhen changing positions: When a regular staff employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their sick time. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding sick time, including policies regarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals. If a regular staff employee's acceptance of a new position results in a limit on sick time accruals due to the policy applicable to the new position, any sick time in excess of the limit will be returned to the employee's accruals if the employee returns to a regular staff employee position consistent with the service bridging timelines set out in Section 2 of Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting & Hiring of Regular Staff.\nNo advance: Sick time must be accrued before it can be used.\nDuring temporary layoff, sick time accrues as if the laid-off regular staff employee continued to work regular time. (For more information, see Section 2 of Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.17: Layoffs).\nIf a regular staff employee separates from the University in good standing and is rehired by the University into a regular staff employee position within 12 months from the date of separation, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated. In the case of a layoff, previously accrued and unused sick days shall be reinstated if the regular staff employee is rehired into a regular staff employee position within 24 months from the date of layoff. (For more information about the University's policy regarding bridging of service, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting & Hiring of Regular Staff.)\nSick time shall not be paid out upon separation of employment.\nA maximum of 40 hours or five scheduled workdays of protected sick time use per year, whichever is greater, may be used pursuant to the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522 and Senate Bill 616. After this amount of sick time has been used, regular staff employees may use remaining sick time pursuant to this Guide Memo 2.1.7, and the remaining sick time is not subject to the protections of the California Paid Sick Leave Law.\nc. No Sick Time Accrues\nNo sick time accrues during periods of leave with or without pay beginning 8/1/05 or later, including short-term disability, long-term disability, worker's compensation and family temporary disability wage replacement (FTD).\nNo sick time accrues during a laid off or retiring regular staff employee's use of terminal vacation. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations.)\n2. Acceptable and Unacceptable Uses of Sick Time\na. Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a regular staff employee's illness or injury prevents the regular staff employee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments. Medical and dental appointments may also be charged to vacation, PTO or floating holiday. Medical and dental appointments include:\nDiagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventive care\nAppointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault or Stalking\nSick time may be used by a regular staff employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking in order to:\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, restraining order or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety or welfare of the victim or their child\nSeek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking\nObtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking\nObtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking\nParticipate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, including a temporary or permanent relocation\nd. University Holidays and Sick Time\nFor holidays that occur on days when a regular staff employee's absence due to illness/injury is fully charged to sick time, and the regular staff employee is not on other leave status, the time off is charged as a paid holiday.\ne. During Vacation\nWhen a regular staff employee is hospitalized or confined to bed by medical direction while on vacation, the time of hospitalization/confinement should be charged to accrued sick time. If appropriate, a claim should be submitted for disability plan benefits. (For instructions about submitting a disability claim, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\nf. During Winter Closure\nIf a regular staff employee has to use vacation, PTO or floating holiday for certain days during Winter Closure, accrued sick time may be used instead but only in the following limited circumstances:\nSick time may be used for days during Winter Closure that occur within an approved medical leave period, provided the regular staff employee was on the approved medical leave immediately prior to Winter Closure.\nSick time may be used for days during Winter Closure for which Lincoln Financial approved or approves disability or family temporary disability payments and for which days the regular staff employee needs to use paid sick time in order to maintain base pay. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\ng. Family Sick Time\n(1) Family Sick Time\nRegular staff employees may use a maximum of 15 sick days during a calendar year of service (January 1 to December 31) for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a regular staff employee's family member. For the purpose of this policy, family member includes, as the terms below are defined by law, only the regular staff employee's:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the regular staff employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the regular staff employees stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child's age or dependency status\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a regular staff employee or the regular staff employee's spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the regular staff employee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\n(2) \nRegular staff employees may use up to 3 days out of the maximum of 15 available family sick days for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a designated person. \u201cDesignated person\u201d means a person identified by the regular staff employee at the time the regular staff employee requests paid sick days. A regular staff employee is limited to one \u201cdesignated person\u201d per 12-month period for such paid sick days.\n(3) \nRegular staff employees may also apply for family sick leave. (For instructions about submitting a family sick leave claim, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\nh. Use of Sick Time to Maintain Pay during Disability\nUnless the regular staff employee applies to their department in writing for an exception, which is approved, the university uses a regular staff employee's accrued sick time to maintain the regular staff employee's base pay during times when the regular staff employee is receiving disability benefits payments. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves.)\nj. Unacceptable Use of Sick Time:\nUnless otherwise specifically allowed by this Guide Memo 2.1.7, sick time may only be used for an absence that a regular staff employee has during scheduled work hours.\n3. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe regular staff employee reports the absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how regular staff employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the regular staff employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the regular staff employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. Regular staff employees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department. Where flexible schedules are possible for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a regular staff employee's work hours.\nb. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use\nThe University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to record sick time credited, used and accumulated for all regular staff employees. Records must be updated each pay period for all employees who used sick time. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees. For information about Axess see the Time & Leave System overview.)\nc. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service. An adjustment is made at the beginning of the following month when the actual accrual is different than anticipated.\nd. Tax Status\nSick time is taxable income. Federal, state, and FICA taxes are deducted.\ne. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a regular staff employee's use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a regular staff employee's failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met. The University may request supporting documentation for any sick leave used in excess of 40 hours (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) per year of employment.\n(2) Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time\nIf the University has reasonable basis to believe that a regular staff employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a regular staff employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable Medical Evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner's statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when a regular staff employee is released to return to work.\nf. Applying for Disability\nA regular staff employee must apply for disability benefits if using sick time for more than 5 consecutive working or 7 consecutive calendar days for the same illness or injury."}

Family Sick Time\nContingent employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a contingent employee's family member. For the purpose of this policy, family member includes, as the terms are defined by law, only the contingent employee's:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the contingent employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the contingent employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child\u2019s age or dependency status)\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a contingent employee or the contingent employee\u2019s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the contingent employee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\nContingent employees may use up to 40 hours or five (5) days of their accrued sick time for diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a designated person. \u201cDesignated person\u201d means a person identified by the contingent employee at the time the contingent employee requests paid sick days. A contingent employee is limited to one \u201cdesignated person\u201d per 12-month period for such paid sick days.\n3. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe contingent employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how contingent employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the contingent employee shall provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the contingent employee shall provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. If a contingent employee has accrued sick time available and has not reached applicable limits of sick time use per year of employment, a request to use sick time should not be denied because details are not provided about the sick time use. Contingent employees may be asked to schedule appointments at a time convenient for the department. Where flexible schedules work for the department, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a contingent employee\u2019s work hours.\nb. Recording and Reporting Sick Time Accumulation and Use\nThe University uses the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS) to record sick time credited, used, and accumulated for all contingent employees. Contingent employees record hours of sick time used in the Axess Timecard each pay period. The use of sick time is limited to 40 hours (or five scheduled workdays, whichever is greater) during each year of employment. Up to 40 hours of sick time use may be recorded in Axess; if a contingent employee has three scheduled work days of sick time use that exceeds 40 hours, the contingent employee should request assistance from the local Human Resources Office. Contingent employees are not paid for time spent away from work in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment, and such time is not recorded in Axess. (For information about Axess, see the Time & Leave System overview.)\nc. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service, calculated based upon work hours recorded during the previous month. If a contingent employee needs to use sick time that has been accrued but not yet credited in Axess, the contingent employee should speak to the local Human Resources Office for assistance.\nd. Tax Status\nSick time is taxable income. Federal, state and FICA taxes are deducted.\ne. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical Confirmation Related to Use of Sick Time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a contingent employee\u2019s use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a contingent employee\u2019s failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met.\n(2) Medical Confirmation Related to Possible Abuse or Misuse of Sick Time\nIf the University has reasonable basis to believe that a contingent employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five (5) scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a contingent employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (e.g., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable Medical Evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner\u2019s statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when the contingent employee is released to return to work.\nf. Sources of Funds for Sick Time\nAs sick time is used to replace scheduled work hours, it should be recorded in Axess on the timecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is charged to the department that owns this job record.\ng. Applicable Laws\nThe intent of this Guide Memo 2.1.22 is to meet or exceed requirements of all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522 and Senate Bill 616.\n4. Disability Insurance and Family Temporary Disability\na. Voluntary Disability Insurance (VDI) and Short Term Disability (STD)\nThe VDI and STD plans provide partial income continuation for periods of disability. Stanford\u2019s VDI and STD plans are administered by Lincoln Financial and there are specific rules regarding disability insurance benefits, including rules about eligibility and duration. For more information, contingent employees should contact their supervisors, the applicable local Human Resources office, or contact the University HR Service Team; they also may contact Lincoln Financial at (800) 896-9375 or submit a claim at https://www.mylincolnportal.com (claimant service ID: stanford).\nb. Family Temporary Disability (FTD)\nFTD provides partial income replacement to care for seriously ill family members or to bond with a new child. Stanford\u2019s FTD plan is administered by Lincoln Financial, and there are specific rules regarding the FTD benefit, including rules about eligibility. For more information, contingent employees should contact their supervisors, the applicable local Human Resources office, or contact the University HR Service Team; they also may contact Lincoln Financial at (800) 896-9375 or submit a claim at https://www.mylincolnportal.com (claimant service ID: stanford)."}

This policy is effective starting on July 1, 2015.\n1. Sick Time Benefits\nSick time provides a mechanism to pay student hourly employees when they are unable to perform their scheduled work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons as detailed below. All Stanford \u201cstudent hourly employees\u201d (as defined in section 2. Definitions, below) receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee\u2019s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours.\n2. Definitions\nAll Stanford undergraduate and graduate students who are hired on an hourly basis are referred to as \u201cstudent hourly employees\u201d in this policy. This Administrative Guide Memo applies to Stanford students hired on an hourly basis as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 10.1.1: Undergraduate Student Employment on Campus and Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.2: Graduate Student Hourly Employment. Graduate students hired in an assistantship appointment (see Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships) and Postdoctoral Fellows and Postdoctoral Research Affiliates (see Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions) are not student hourly employees.\n3. Accrual and Recording of Sick Time\na. Accrual of Sick Time\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time as follows:\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time at the rate of .03334 hours per hour worked. This equates to one (1) hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.\nUnused sick time accumulates from year-to-year, with a maximum limit of 80 hours or ten (10) days.\nStudent hourly employees accrue sick time for all hourly jobs worked at Stanford, regardless of the department of employment. When a student hourly employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the University, the student hourly employee\u2019s sick time balance is maintained as long as the new position starts within 12 months of the date of termination from the first position. If the new position is not a student hourly employee position, the student hourly employee is subject to any sick time policies applicable to the new position, including, without limitation, any policies regarding sick time use and limits on sick time accruals.\nb. Recording Sick Time Accrual\nA student hourly employee\u2019s accrued sick time is recorded in Axess with the sick time balance reported on the student hourly employee\u2019s pay statement.\n4. Use of Sick Time\nSick time is paid only when used to replace scheduled work hours during the course of employment. Otherwise, sick time balances are not paid out.\nArrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee\u2019s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments at a time outside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee\u2019s work hours.\nStudent hourly employees are entitled to use accrued sick time beginning on the 90th calendar day after the start of employment. Sick time must be accrued before it can be used. The use of sick time is limited to 40 hours or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater, each year of employment. Sick time may only be used for an absence that a student hourly employee has during scheduled work hours.\nSick time is not paid out when a student hourly employee ends employment for any reason, including, without limitation, no longer being employed in a student hourly employee position, leaving the University for any reason, taking a leave of absence, or being in non-enrollment status.\nSick time may be used for the following reasons:\na. Absence Due to Illness or Injury\nSick time may be used when a student hourly employee\u2019s illness or injury prevents the student hourly employee from working.\nb. Medical and Dental Appointments\nSick time may be used for all medical and dental appointments, including:\nDiagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition\nPreventive care\nThose appointments associated with a work injury (e.g., physical therapy)\nc. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking\nSick time may be used by a student hourly employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking in order to:\nObtain or attempt to obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or welfare of the victim or their child\nSeek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nObtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nObtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking\nParticipate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation\nd. Family Sick Time\nStudent hourly employees may use sick time for diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, a student hourly employee\u2019s family member. For the purpose of this policy, a family member includes the student hourly employee\u2019s:\nSpouse or registered domestic partner\nChildren of the student hourly employee or spouse or registered domestic partner (including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the student hourly employee stands in loco parentis, regardless of the child\u2019s age or dependency status)\nParents and parents-in-law (including a biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of a student hourly employee or the student hourly employee\u2019s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the student hourly employee was a minor)\nBrothers and sisters\nGrandparents or grandchildren\nOther family member dependent on the student hourly employee and living in the student hourly employee's household\n5. Administration\na. Notification of Absence\nThe student hourly employee reports an absence (or planned absence) to the supervisor. The department is responsible for establishing and communicating rules on how student hourly employees notify the department of absences. If the need for sick time use is foreseeable, the student hourly employee should provide reasonable advance notice. If the need for sick time use is unforeseeable, the student hourly employee should provide notice of the need for sick time use as soon as practicable. If a student hourly employee requests to use accrued sick time and the student hourly employee\u2019s use of sick time is within applicable limits per year of employment, the request should not be denied because details are not provided about the sick time use.\nTo the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to schedule appointments at a time outside of working hours. Where flexible schedules are possible, supervisors are encouraged to accommodate appointments by flexing a student hourly employee\u2019s work hours.\nb. Medical Confirmation\n(1) Medical confirmation related to use of sick time\nAcceptable medical evidence may be required for the use of sick time. However, for a student hourly employee's use of the first 40 hours of sick time (or five scheduled work days, whichever is greater) during each year of employment, excepting circumstances involving abuse or misuse of sick time as stated in subpart (2) below, supervisors may not require acceptable medical evidence, and supervisors should not deny sick time use based on a student hourly employee's failure to provide details about the sick time use. The supervisor who approves the use of sick time is responsible for confirming that the conditions for use of sick time are met.\n(2) Medical confirmation related to possible abuse or misuse of sick time\nIf the University has reasonable basis to believe that a student hourly employee may have engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time at any time (even during the first 40 hours or five scheduled workdays of sick time use during each year of employment), the University may ask for acceptable medical evidence or other proof showing that a student hourly employee has not engaged in abuse or misuse of sick time. Abuse or misuse of sick time, failure to follow sick time notification procedures (i.e., failing to provide reasonable advance notice for foreseeable sick time use, not providing requested medical information when abuse or misuse is suspected, or not giving notice as soon as practicable for unforeseeable sick time use) may be a basis for discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Also, use of sick time may be denied if there is abuse or misuse of sick time.\n(3) Acceptable medical evidence\nAcceptable medical evidence includes, but is not limited to, a healthcare practitioner\u2019s statement that certifies a medical need for sick time, the expected duration of absence and anticipated return to work date, and any work-related limitations or restrictions (including the duration of those limitations or restrictions) when the student hourly employee is released to return to work.\nc. Reporting Sick Time Use\nStudent hourly employees record hours of sick time used in the Axess Timecard each pay period. Student hourly employees may only be paid for the number of sick time hours that they have accrued and which is available to them. The use of sick time is limited to 40 hours or five scheduled work days each year of employment, whichever is greater. Up to 40 hours of sick time use may be recorded in Axess; if a student hourly employee has five scheduled work days of sick time use that exceeds 40 hours, the student hourly employee should request assistance from the local Human Resources office. Student hourly employees are not paid for time spent away from work in excess of the sick time limit per year of employment, and such time is not recorded in Axess. For information about Axess see this Time & Leave System overview.\nd. Sick Time Credit Date\nSick time must be accrued before it can be used. Sick time is credited at the beginning of each month of service, calculated based upon work hours recorded during the previous month. If a student hourly employee needs to use sick time that has been accrued but not yet credited in Axess, the student hourly employee should speak to the local Human Resources office for assistance.\ne. Tax Status\nIncome that the student hourly employee receives for sick time is taxable. Applicable taxes are deducted.\nf. Multiple Forms of Employment\nStudent hourly employees who are employed by Stanford in other ways are affected as follows:\nAssistantships: Graduate students who have assistantship appointments, either concurrently or at different times of the year, will see a separate accounting of sick time accrued for the assistantship appointment. (For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships)\nTemporary or casual employment: Students who are hired as temporary or casual employees in the same 12 month period in which they were student hourly employees will have previously accrued sick time, up to the applicable limits, available for use. Temporary or casual employment for students typically occurs in summer, following graduation, or when a student is on a leave of absence\nScholarship, fellowship, and stipend support: Students who receive stipend support for a scholarship, fellowship, or other reasons, are not Stanford employees and do not receive a sick time benefit\ng. Sources of Funds for Sick Time\nAs sick time is used to replace scheduled work time, it should be recorded in Axess on the timecard associated with the job for which the work time was scheduled. Sick time used is charged to the department that owns this job record. Departments employing a student on Federal Work Study must provide their own unrestricted funding to pay for sick time when used. This unrestricted PTA should be recorded on the timecard as sick time is used.\nh. Applicable Laws\nThe intent of this Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1 is to meet or exceed requirements of all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the California Paid Sick Leave Law enacted by Assembly Bill 1522 and Senate Bill 616."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/policy/administrative-guide-policy-218-miscellaneous-authorized-absences", "text": "2.1.8 Miscellaneous Authorized Absences | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.7\nThis policy summarizes absences, paid and unpaid, approved by the university.\nApplicability:\nExcept as otherwise specified, applies to all regular employees as defined in Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time: Regular Staff Employees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians. For policies that apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining.\n1. Paid Absences\nPaid absences approved in advance count as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime payment [refer to Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees, section 5.b(3)]. The university authorizes these absences: Vacations in Guide Memo 2.1.6, Sick Time in Guide Memo 2.1.7, and Paid Holidays in Guide Memo 2.1.13. In addition, the following absences with continuation of pay are authorized by the university:\na. Voting\nWhen a regular full-time employee, because of the work schedule, is not able to vote outside of regularly scheduled work hours, supervisors shall authorize necessary time off, but not to exceed two hours with pay. Such time off should be scheduled when least disruptive to the department's work.\nb. Jury Duty\nA regular employee summoned to jury duty receives time off with pay for the periods of absence from scheduled work as required by the court. The employee retains any payments received from the court. The employee must provide verification from the court or jury commissioner of time spent on required jury duty.\nc. Court Appearances\nA regular employee subpoenaed as a witness in a non-work-related matter receives time off with pay for the periods of absence from scheduled work as required by the court.\nAbsences to appear as a plaintiff or defendant in a non-work-related matter should be charged to personal time off, vacation leave, or personal leave without pay.\nd. Personal Time Off\n(1) Use of Personal Time Off\nA regular employee may take time off from scheduled work for personal reasons with the supervisor's prior approval. An appropriate use of available Personal Time Off (PTO) is to continue pay during winter close. A full-time employee may use a maximum of 24 hours of paid time off for their personal reasons each year. The maximum allowance per year should be pro-rated for newly hired or rehired employees, and for part-time employees.\nPTO is available at the beginning of the calendar year. Employees may \"borrow\" up to their full amount of PTO before it is credited to cover time that would otherwise be unpaid during winter close. PTO may not be carried forward from year to year. If the employee is to be terminated and has unused PTO, arrange for the employee to take PTO before termination. Any remaining unused PTO is paid in the employee's final paycheck.\n(2) Reporting Personal Time Off\nNon-Exempt Employees: Record all PTO taken during a pay period in the human resources management system (Axess/PeopleSoft HRMS).\nExempt Employees: PTO is generally not reported in increments of less than four hours. For reporting purposes of four or more hours, record a minimum of four hours or the actual time taken if over four hours.\n(3) Scheduling Personal Time Off\nAn employee is not obligated to explain how they intend to use personal time off. Specific arrangements are subject to supervisory approval and scheduling compatible with departmental operational needs.\n(4) Change in Status\nWhen an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their unused PTO. The employee is subject to any policies applicable to the new position regarding PTO, including policies regarding PTO use and limits on PTO allowance.\nf. PTO Augmenting Disability Payments\nUnless the employee applies to their department for an exception, which is approved, the university uses an employee's accrued time off (sick, PTO for the calendar year, floating holiday and vacation, in that order) to maintain the employee's base pay during times when the employee is receiving disability benefit payments. See Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves, section 6.\ng. Bereavement Leave\n(1) Regular Employee\nA regular employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave with regular pay upon the death of a close family member. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the death of the close family member. When additional time off is needed, a department may approve use of vacation or personal leave without pay.\n(2) Contingent Employee\nA contingent (i.e. casual or temporary) employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave without pay upon the death of a close family member. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the death of the close family member.\n(3) Definition of Close Family Member\nA Close Family Member is limited to the employee's spouse; same-sex domestic partner; children of the employee, spouse or same-sex domestic partner; parents and parents-in-law; brothers and sisters of the employee; and grandparents and grandchildren of the employee as these terms are defined by law. An employee may be asked to provide documentation of the death of the close family member. If you have questions about how a close family member is defined, please contact University Human Resources-Employee & Labor Relations.\n(4) Notification of Requested Leave\nThe employee should inform their supervisor of the need for bereavement leave as soon as practicable.\nh. Reproductive Loss Leave\n(1) Regular Employee\nA regular employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave following a reproductive loss event. Employees may use available vacation, sick leave, or personal leave without pay. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the reproductive loss event. \nIf an employee experiences more than one reproductive loss event within a 12-month period, the employee may take up to five days of leave following a subsequent reproductive loss event, but no more than 20 days within a 12-month period. \n(2) Contingent Employee\nA contingent (i.e. casual or temporary) employee, as defined in Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, may take up to five days of leave following a reproductive loss event. Employees may use available sick leave or personal leave without pay. The days do not need to be taken consecutively but must be taken within three months of the reproductive loss event. \nIf an employee experiences more than one reproductive loss event within a 12-month period, the employee may take up to five days of leave following a subsequent reproductive loss event, but no more than 20 days within a 12-month period.\n(3) Definition of Reproductive Loss Event\nA reproductive loss event means the day or, for a multiple-day event, the final day of a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted reproduction.\n(4) Notification of Requested Leave\nThe employee should inform their supervisor of the need for reproductive loss leave as soon as practicable.\ni. Military Training Leave\nWhen required to perform annual military training duty a regular employee receives time off for the period of actual training, up to 17 calendar days a year. The university supplements the employee's military base pay for the scheduled working days of absence, up to the employee's full salary or wage. Employees must complete one year of employment in order to receive supplemental military training pay from the university. (Refer to section 4.f. for procedures.) See your Human Resources Manager for more information.\nj. Paid Organ Donor Leave\nUnder California law, eligible employees are entitled to a paid leave of absence up to 30 days for the purpose of organ donation and up to 5 days for bone marrow donation in any one-year period. Use of accrued time for a portion of the leave will be required to the extent permitted by law. For details, see Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability & Family Leave, section 4.\nk. Paid Leave during Natural Disasters and Emergencies\nWhen the Vice President for Human Resources, in coordination with university leadership, determines that a natural disaster, emergency, or certain other extraordinary circumstances prevent regular employees from performing work, paid time off will be provided to those impacted for the first three days of their regularly scheduled time that they are unable to work. \nIf the particular circumstances exceed three days, the Vice President for Human Resources, in coordination with university leadership, will determine whether and for how long Paid Leave During Natural Disasters and Emergencies will continue, any changes in eligibility requirements, or any changes in compensation or benefits provided. Employees who are not scheduled to work, are on another paid or unpaid leave of absence, or are able and assigned to perform work (for example if an employee can safely work from another location) are not eligible for Paid Leave during Natural Disasters and Emergencies. \nExamples of situations where this policy may apply include natural disasters or other emergencies such as earthquake, wildfire, or inclement weather which cause evacuation, stoppage of operations, or other inability to continue to perform work. There will be notification by the university if such a situation arises.\n2. Other Absences\nNOTE: These leaves of themselves are unpaid and do not result in the employee receiving pay from the university. Depending on the nature of the leave, however, an employee may be required to use other accrued time off, e.g., accrued vacation, personal time off, or sick time, during the leave or may be eligible to receive disability benefits pursuant to the terms of the university's Voluntary Disability Insurance plan.\na. Types of Leave of Absence Without Pay\n(1) Personal Leave\nA regular employee may be placed on personal leave without pay at a department's discretion. Extra time off in conjunction with paid vacation or time off to take care of family circumstances are examples of situations that may be the basis for granting personal leave.\n(2) Disability Leave\nSee Guide Memo 2.1.7: Sick Time: Regular Staff Employees, Regular Academic Staff-Research and Regular Academic Staff-Professional Librarians, and Guide Memo 2.3.5: Disability and Family Leaves, for information relating to leaves necessitated by the employee's own injury or illness or the illness of a family member.\n(3) Professional or Educational Leave\nA regular employee may be granted a leave of absence by a department to pursue activities or educational courses that will enhance the employee's value to the university. This type of leave should not exceed one year. Stanford Benefits must be notified prior to the leave start date for continuation of the university\u2019s contributions toward health benefits plans and retirement savings plan. (Time for participation in training, education, or professional development required and assigned by the department is paid work time. Refer to Guide Memo 2.1.12: Staff Development Program, for policy regarding time off with pay to participate in staff training and development programs.)\n(4) Public Service Leave\nA department may grant a regular employee a leave of absence for temporary participation in community, state, or national affairs, including elective public office. However, long-term or continuing full-time employment by a public or community agency normally is not a suitable basis for approval of a leave of absence.\n(5) Military Service Leave\nA regular employee who voluntarily enters military service or is called for active duty for an extended period should contact their Human Resources Manager for more information. [For short-time periods of military training duty refer to \"military training leave\" under 1.f. above; for leave of absence right for spouses of military personnel refer to 2.a.(6)-Other Leaves, below.] Certain leaves for family of members of the armed forces are outlined in Guide Memo 2.1.18: Military Leave.\n(6) Other Leaves\nThe university provides leaves of absence as required by law, such as Volunteer Firefighters Leave, Parent's Leave for School Discipline, Parent's Leave for Children in School, Literacy Leave, time off from work for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, absence from work for victims of crime and certain persons related to victims for judicial proceedings, and leave of absence right for spouses of military personnel while such personnel are on a leave from deployment. Consult with Employee and Labor Relations for details about any of these leaves. \nb. Benefits Continuation During Unpaid Absences\n(1) Benefits Continuation\nThe employee's insurance and health care plans will continue during an unpaid leave of absence if the employee pays their portion of the cost of coverage. Exception: An employee on a personal leave of absence must pay the entire cost of coverage (employee and employer portion). The employee will be billed the appropriate amount for their benefits during the unpaid leave of absence.\n(2) Retirement Contributions\nAll retirement plan contributions stop while employees are on an unpaid leave of absence.\n(3) Benefits Cancellation\nAn employee on an unpaid leave may choose to cancel coverage during the leave period. If the coverage is not cancelled within 31 days of the start of the leave, the employee will be billed for coverage. To cancel coverage, the employee must take action; visit the Cardinal at Work website or contact the University HR Service Team. The employee can re-enroll in benefits as soon as they return to work in a benefits-eligible position.\n3. Policies for Leaves of Absence\na. Length of Leave\nEach leave of absence must be for a definite period with specific starting and ending dates. A leave cannot extend beyond the end of a fixed-term appointment. Whenever a proposed leave will result in a total period of absence exceeding 12 months, prior approval is required from local Human Resources Manager and the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee) or the Director of Human Resources at SLAC. Approval of leaves exceeding 12 months should be rare.\nb. Reinstatement Requirement\nA department granting or recommending a leave of absence is obligated to reinstate the employee in the same or a similar position at the end of the leave. Under special circumstances, the Vice President for Human Resources (or their designee) may approve a recommended leave when the employee has waived in writing the reemployment obligation. A leave of absence is not appropriate when the employee cannot provide reasonable assurance of intention to return to University employment at the end of the leave.\nc. Termination of Leave by Layoff\nWhen a layoff situation occurs in a department while an employee is on a leave of absence, normal layoff procedures will apply and will include the employee on leave. If a leave is terminated by layoff, the standard provisions for severance pay, reemployment, and benefits continuation are applicable.\nd. Failure to Return from Leave\nWhen an employee does not return to work at the end of a leave, or when a department learns that an employee will not return, the department initiates a termination of the leave and of the individual's employee status, citing the reason for the employee's separation.\n4. Guide to Supervisors\na. Records\nPeopleSoft/Axess should reflect both paid and unpaid absences indicating the type of leave and the period of absence. Retain in the department files documentation such as evidence of disability and written request for leave.\nb. Advance Approval\nWhen a leave requires advance approval from the Vice President for Human Resources (or the Director of Human Resources at SLAC), the department's request for approval should include the department's written recommendation.\nc. Change in Circumstances During Leave Without Pay\nWhen any change in circumstances make it necessary to modify a leave of absence, discuss the situation with the Human Resources Manager before any action is taken.\nd. Benefit Plan Arrangements\nEmployees on an unpaid leave of absence will be billed by Vita Administration Companies for their insurance and health plan premiums on an after-tax basis. Employees must pay the premiums promptly to Vita.\ne. Work Schedule Modifications\nSupervisors should adhere to University policies and government requirements regarding overtime pay when modifying a nonexempt employee's work schedule to provide the employee with personal time off. (See Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees, for policies on work scheduling.)\nf. Procedures for Military Training Pay\nThe employee should be placed on Leave of Absence Unpaid for reason of Military Service so health and life benefits are not interrupted. When training leave ends, the employee must provide a copy of the pay stub verifying income received from the military. The department then adjusts the employee's pay for the leave period so that the adjusted salary plus military pay equals the usual full-time salary. (See Guide Memo 2.1.18: Military Leave.)\ng. Reemployment Rights of Veterans\nAny employee who enters military service may have legally guaranteed reemployment rights. When an employee goes into military service, the employee's department should obtain information about these rights from Human Resources."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/policy/administrative-guide-policy-611-privacy-and-access-electronic-information", "text": "6.1.1 Privacy and Access to Electronic Information\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 61\nThis guide memo establishes a policy on privacy in Electronic Information and the circumstances under which Electronic Information may be accessed and/or disclosed without User Consent.\n1. Summary\na. Purposes of Policy\nEstablish a policy on privacy in Electronic Information and the circumstances under which Electronic Information may be accessed and/or disclosed without User Consent.\nb. Scope\nThis policy applies to:\nAll University Information Technology (IT) Resources;\nAll Users of University IT Resources, including staff, faculty, students, contractors, volunteers and visitors; and\nAll Electronic Information.\nDefinitions of terms used in this policy are provided, below, in Section 2.\nThis policy does not apply to the routine use of Electronic Information by those who send and receive Electronic Information in the expectation that the Electronic Information will be used by intended recipients and others in the normal course of their duties. Additionally, a User who holds records for the university may not deny Access to those records to others within the university with a need for those records to conduct university business. Rather, this policy applies to Access to Electronic Information by university officials and others who would not routinely use the Electronic Information but would do so in order to fulfill special conditions of university business, or to respond to legal demands from outside the university, as described in Section 4, Access Without User Consent, below. \nc. Principles\nCommunication among members of the Stanford University community is essential for all university operations, teaching, and research. This communication can take many forms, including through the use of University IT Resources. Stanford University encourages the use of University IT Resources to share information and knowledge in support of the university's mission of education, research, and public service, and to conduct the university's business. To this end, the university provides and supports a broad array of electronic communications services and facilities.\nBecause the University provides IT Resources to facilitate electronic communication and data storage, the University could Access Electronic Information and the scope and ease of this Access likely surpass that which the university has to non-electronic data, cell phone calls, or other personal conversations among its faculty, staff, and students.\nThis policy therefore sets out guidelines and processes that apply when the university seeks Access to Electronic Information. Our goal is to act in accordance with the university\u2019s legal and ethical obligations, while also seeking to maintain an environment in which free academic inquiry thrives. This policy, along with federal, state, local and, in some circumstances, foreign laws, provides the rules and procedures under which the university may Access and disclose electronic information.\nAccordingly, the policy is grounded on seven important principles:\nAccess should occur only for a legitimate purpose;\nAccess should be authorized by one or more appropriate and accountable people;\nExcept as described herein, when the university is subject to a legal process to release a User\u2019s Electronic Information to a third-party outside of the university, it should give Notice to the User before releasing the requested information;\nExcept as described herein, the university should obtain User Consent before a User\u2019s Electronic Information is Accessed;\nAccess should be limited to the minimum Electronic Information necessary to accomplish the purpose, and the university should take reasonable steps to avoid Access to information on private machines that it has no reason to believe is university information;\nSufficient records should be kept to enable appropriate review of compliance with this policy; and\nThe process for access should be transparent and reviewable by the Steering Committee of the Faculty Senate as described in 5.e. (Transparency and Access Records).\nIn general, the University does not Access or disclose Electronic Information without User Consent. The university may Access or disclose Electronic Information without User Consent only under the limited circumstances as described in this policy. Moreover, before releasing a User\u2019s Electronic Information pursuant to legal process, the university will make reasonable efforts to give notice of the third-party request.\n2. Definitions\nThe following definitions apply to this policy. Knowledge of these definitions is important to understand this policy.\nAccess: Review, use, or disclosure of Content or Activity Data that is beyond the incidental contact with Electronic Information in the course of providing University IT systems. For the avoidance of doubt, mere preservation of Electronic Information is not considered Access until review or disclosure occurs.\nAuthorizing Official: The Authorizing Officials include the: President, Provost, Vice President of Business Affairs, General Counsel, Vice Provost of Student Affairs, Vice President for Human Resources, Senior Associate Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, and the Chief Privacy Officer, as appropriate depending on the rationale for Accessing Electronic Information. Each of these Authorizing Officials may designate a deputy to authorize access for circumstances in which the identified officer is unavailable. Additionally, the Chief Information Security Officer is an Authorizing Official for System Protection, Maintenance, and Management.\nElectronic Information: Electronic Information consists of both of the following types of information:\nContent: The substance, purport or meaning of communications between two or more people, or files created on, transmitted through or stored in University IT Resources, including information that a User backs up on University IT Resources from a User-owned device, and\nActivity Data: Data automatically generated by use of University IT Resources, including records of Internet use and logs of access to university facilities, and which are accessible from systems maintained by the university or its agents.\nCompelling Circumstances: Circumstances in which obtaining User Consent could result in bodily harm to humans or animals, significant property loss or damage, or destruction of evidence.\nEmergency Circumstances: Circumstances in which time is of the essence and the university needs to act immediately to protect against bodily harm to humans or animals, or significant property loss or damage.\nNotice of Third Party Request: With regard to circumstances in which an outside party is seeking Electronic Information of a User through any legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, warrant, government investigation, or civil litigation demand involving the University, notification to the User of the request prior to the release of the requested Electronic Information and as further described in section E.5., Transparency and Access Records, below.\nUniversity Investigation: An allegation, which in the judgment of the General Counsel, the Vice President for Human Resources, or Senior Associate Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, requires investigation of a potential violation of law or a University policy listed in Appendix A, Policies Relating to Access Without Consent. University Investigation also includes an audit conducted at the direction of the Office of the Chief Risk Officer to ensure ongoing university compliance in the areas subject to Appendix A.\nUniversity IT Resources: All computer and communication devices, services, networks, and other technologies that access, store, or transmit personal or university information and that are owned, provided, or administered by or through the university, regardless of whether they are owned or controlled by the university or by an external electronic service provider with which the university contracts.\nUser: Any person or entity who:\nUses University IT Resources to create, download, store, transmit, or process information of any kind; and\nIs authorized to use University IT Resources.\nUser Consent: Following a description of the purpose and the extent of a request for Access to Electronic Information, express consent to Access, use, and/or disclose Electronic Information by one or more Users:\nWho are a party to, as either a creator, sender, or recipient of, Electronic Information Content, or\nWhose Activity Data is sought.\n3. Privacy and Confidentiality\na. Introduction\nThe university recognizes that academic freedom, shared governance, and freedom of speech require personal privacy. This policy seeks to ensure these firmly-held principles within the context of compliance with the university\u2019s legal and other obligations. The university respects the privacy of Electronic Information in the same way that it respects the privacy of paper correspondence and telephone conversations. Simultaneously, the university seeks to ensure that university administrative records are accessible for the conduct of the university's business and seeks to meet its obligations to justify the use of private and public funds, investigate allegations of research misconduct or violation of standards of authorship, conduct fact-finding and remediation for suspected violations of the ethics and law of research using humans and animals, and inquire into and resolve allegations of noncompliance or of misconduct, such as discrimination, harassment, theft, extortion, blackmail, or acts or threats of violence.\nb. Information Available to the University\nAs an Internet service provider, an electronic communications service provider, a backup provider, a storage provider, and more, the university is capable of accessing Electronic Information generated by User interaction with these services. Even when using personally owned devices, user interactions with University IT Resources generates Activity Data that can often be attributed to an individual while also identifying that person\u2019s physical location to varying degrees of precision. Users should be aware that the university has or could have Access to many categories of information, including but not limited to those described in Appendix B.\nAll Users might be involved in circumstances over the course of their time at Stanford in which Electronic Information could legitimately be accessed by the university under Section 4, Access Without User Consent, below. Therefore, the university advises all Users who use university resources for personal matters that the university might Access Electronic Information pertaining to such matters under this policy. Accordingly, the best protection Users have to keep the university from Accessing private personal matters, is to keep such matters off of university resources. To the extent Users wish to keep private from the university such personal matters, the Users should consider using non-university resources for such matters. \nEven under circumstances in which the university may legitimately Access Electronic Information under this policy, it will not disclose such Accessed Electronic Information to third-parties absent Notice of a Third Party Request and/or User Consent, unless (a) required to do so by law or legal process; (b) to protect life or property; or (c) to report a crime relating to or indicated by the Electronic Information.\nc. Privacy Obligations of University Employees and Agents\nThis policy prohibits university employees and their agents from Accessing Electronic Information except in accordance with this policy. University employees shall take necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of personal information encountered either in the performance of their duties or otherwise. University contracts with outside vendors that will have access to personally identifiable Electronic Information shall include references to this policy, to applicable privacy laws that protect the information, or language that limits the third-party contractor from using the information for any purpose other than to perform the services of the Agreement, or as required by law.\nIn addition to legal sanctions, violators of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion, pursuant to university policies and collective bargaining agreements. If a User\u2019s Electronic Information has been Accessed in violation of this policy, the affected individual should be promptly notified. Where such a policy violation also requires a legal notification under an applicable law, the legal notice will serve as the notification required under this section. \nd. Audio or Video Conversations\nIn compliance with law, conversations shall not be recorded or monitored without advising all participants, unless a court has explicitly ordered such monitoring or recording to occur without notice. Emergency services shall record 911-type emergency calls in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.\nCallers shall be informed when a call is being monitored or recorded for the purpose of evaluating customer service, assessing workload, or any other business purpose permitted by law. \n4. Access Without User Consent\nExcept as otherwise provided in this policy, the university will obtain User Consent prior to any Access except under the conditions described below.\na. System Protection, Maintenance, and Management\nUniversity IT Resources require ongoing maintenance and inspection to ensure that they are operating properly; to ensure they are in compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations; and to protect against security threats such as cyber attacks, malware, and phishing. University IT Resources also require regular management, for example, in order to deploy software updates. Accordingly, to perform this work, the university and its approved vendors may scan or otherwise Access Electronic Information without User Consent.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer may authorize Access for System Protection, Maintenance, and Management.\nIn that process, University IT personnel may observe certain Activity Data or other Electronic Information. Except as provided elsewhere in this policy or by law, University IT personnel are not permitted to seek out Electronic Information, including Contents or Activity Data, when not germane to system operations and support. Any unavoidable examination of Electronic Information shall be limited to the minimum required to perform such duties. This exception does not exempt systems personnel from the prohibition against disclosure of personal or confidential information.\nIf, in the course of their duties, University IT personnel inadvertently discover or suspect violations of law or university policy listed in Appendix A, such personnel may preserve the data and report such violations.\nWhere possible, the university will provide minimally invasive tools to manage User devices and adopt minimally invasive tools to monitor network security without unneeded institutional access.\nb. Emergency Circumstances\nThe University may Access Electronic Information without User Consent in Emergency Circumstances, in which time is of the essence. One Authorizing Official may authorize Access using the least intrusive means to obtain the information necessary to assess and resolve the emergency. The Authorizing Official should weigh the need for Access against other university concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, the integrity of University operations, protection of life and property, and determine that the need for Access outweighs any countervailing considerations.\nc. Compelling Circumstances\nFor Compelling Circumstances, two Authorizing Officials must authorize Access to Electronic Information. When this happens, the Authorizing Officials must make a factual determination that the university investigation/purpose has a sufficient basis to support Access without User Consent. Additionally, the Authorizing Officials should weigh the need for Access against other University concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, integrity of university operations, compliance with law and policies listed in Appendix A, protection of life and property, and determine that the Access of Electronic Information will advance a legitimate institutional purpose and that such need outweighs any countervailing considerations. Only Electronic Information reasonably necessary to assess and/or address the Compelling Circumstances may be accessed or disclosed.\nd. Operational Circumstances\nThe university may Access Electronic Information without User Consent under circumstances in which failure to access the Information would likely cause the University to fail to meet mission-critical governance, administrative, teaching, or research obligations.\nFor Operational Circumstances, two Authorizing Officials must authorize Access to Electronic Information. When this happens, the Authorizing Officials must make a factual determination that the operational circumstances have a sufficient basis to support Access without User Consent. Additionally, the Authorizing Officials should weigh the need for Access against other University concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, and integrity of university operations, and determine that the Access of Electronic Information will advance a legitimate institutional purpose and that such need outweighs any countervailing considerations. Only Electronic Information reasonably necessary to assess and/or address the Operational Circumstances may be accessed or disclosed.\ne. University Investigations\nThe university may Access Electronic Information without User Consent in order to conduct a university investigation of an alleged violation of a legal requirement or a policy listed in Appendix A. Two Authorizing Officials must authorize Access to Electronic Information for university investigations. When this happens, the Authorizing Officials must make a factual determination that the investigation has a sufficient basis to support Access. Additionally, the Authorizing Officials should weigh the need for Access against other university concerns, including academic freedom, personal privacy, the integrity of university operations, compliance with law and policy, protection of life and property, and determine that the Access of Electronic Information will advance a legitimate institutional purpose and that such need outweighs any countervailing considerations.\nf. The Identity of the User is Unknown\nThe university may Access Electronic Information without User Consent when the identity of the User is unknown in order to investigate violations of law or of the university policy. Once the identity of the User is determined, the university may have an obligation under this policy to obtain User Consent for future Access.\ng. Legal Process\nAll requests for Electronic Information arising from legal process, such as search warrants, court orders, national security letters, subpoenas, or other demands related to government investigations or university litigation, must be referred to the Office of the General Counsel or the General Counsel\u2019s designee (OGC). The OGC is responsible for ensuring Notice of a Third Party Request, authorizing Access, and release of Electronic Information under this circumstance.\nIf a person is identified by name in the legal process as the person whose records are being sought, then the university will make reasonable efforts to provide Notice of a Third Party Request to the person/User before Accessing or disclosing Electronic Information and with sufficient notice to enable the User to object in court to the legal request.\nUnder circumstances in which the university does not have evidence that a User has received a copy of the Court Order or Subpoena, the university will either provide a copy of the request to the User using the cover sheet (or its equivalent) provided in Appendix C or in the alternative will make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide verbal or written communication to an affected User:\nthat an outside party requests that the Users\u2019 Electronic Information be Accessed;\nthe identity of the requester of the Electronic Information;\nthe reason for the request, if known;\nthe scope of Electronic Information subject to the request; and\nwhether the User\u2019s consent is required before the University will Access the information.\nA User who does not want information to be released by Stanford should contact the Office of the General Counsel. If university Electronic Information is at issue, the university will work with the User to determine if moving to quash the subpoena is appropriate. If the User\u2019s personal information is at issue (for example, pay records subpoenaed in a personal injury litigation), the User is responsible for moving to quash the subpoena or taking other appropriate legal action to invalidate the legal request to the University. Users in this situation are advised to seek legal counsel for assistance. Students enrolled in degree programs may seek out assistance from the ASSU Legal Counseling Office.\nIn circumstances in which the university is prohibited from disclosing the existence of legal process compelling disclosure of a User\u2019s information (Gag Order), the Office of the General Counsel in consultation with the Privacy Office will determine whether the university has justifiable grounds to challenge the Gag Order.\n5. Additional Procedures\nWhen Electronic Information is accessed without User Consent, as provided for in Section 4, the following additional conditions apply:\na. Authorization\nIf the target of the search is a faculty member, except for Emergency Circumstances, one of the Authorizing Officials will be the President or Provost, who may delegate this authority on a case-by-case basis to a Cabinet member; otherwise, an Authorizing Official may not delegate authority for Access to a faculty member\u2019s Electronic Information. Authorization shall be limited to the least intrusive means to obtain the Electronic Information needed, but sufficient to comply with the university\u2019s obligations. Nothing herein is intended to limit the university\u2019s duty to comply with the law.\nb. Notification of Internal Access\nThe responsible authority or designee shall, at the earliest opportunity that is lawful and preserves the integrity of the investigation, notify the affected User(s) of the action(s) taken and the reasons for the action(s) taken, unless law or policy mandates confidentiality and thereby prevents notification.\nc. Compliance with Law\nAll university Access shall be in full compliance with the law and other applicable university policies.\nd. Advice of Legal Counsel\nUniversity personnel should seek advice from the Office of the General Counsel if assistance is needed regarding this policy. \ne. Transparency and Access Records\nIn determining whether to authorize Access, the designated officials should evaluate all the relevant circumstances for Access including the possible effect of Access on university values. The officials who authorize Access without User Consent for any reason shall create a record of the authorization. The record will include, where applicable:\na description of the Electronic Information that was Accessed;\nthe justification for the Access;\nthe legal process used to compel the Access;\nwhether the User was notified;\nrequests for information involving a Gag Order; and\nnotifications of violations of the policy under C3.\nThe Transparency and Access Records will be submitted to the Information Security Office. The Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for keeping a de-identified summary log of instances of Access to Electronic Information. This log will be made available to the Steering Committee of the Faculty Senate annually. Consistent with university policy, the Steering Committee has the right to request further information. \n6. Retention and Disposition\nElectronic Information is subject to any and all applicable university records management policies.\n7. Appendix A: Policies Relating to Access Without Consent\nThe Privacy and Access to Electronic Information policy cites circumstances under which Access to Electronic Information may occur without User Consent. University policies governing the following subject matter may trigger nonconsensual Access under the procedures defined in Section 4, Access Without User Consent:\nNon-discrimination (Administrative Guide 1.7.4; Stanford Bulletin)\nFinancial management, use of funds (Administrative Guide 3.2.1) and financial irregularities (Administrative Guide 3.5.1)\nSexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, relationship violence and other forms of Prohibited Sexual Conduct (Administrative Guide 1.7)\nResearch compliance (Research Policy Handbook; Student Handbooks; Administrative Guide 1.1.1)\nAcademic misconduct (Honor Code; Fundamental Standard)\nPrivacy of information and privacy breaches (Administrative Guide 1.6)\nSecurity of information (Administrative Guide 6.3.1)\nConflict of commitment, conflict of interest, expenditures prohibited for a non-profit institution (Administrative Guide 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3; Research Policy Handbook 4)\nMisuse of intellectual property (Research Policy Handbook 9; Fundamental Standard)\nMisuse or destruction of university property (Administrative Guide 1.1.1; Property Management Manual 3.5)\nPersonnel policies (Administrative Guide 2)\nViolence in the workplace (Administrative Guide 2.2.4)\nTheft, extortion or blackmail (Administrative Guide 1.1.1)\nProfessionalism (Administrative Guide 1.1.1; Research Policy Handbook 1.1; Stanford Guidelines of Professionalism for Students; Student Handbooks)\nViolations of the Honor Code, Fundamental Standard or Code of Conduct\nViolations relating to Computing and Network Usage (Administrative Guide 6.2.1)\n8.

Capital and operating lease liabilities utilize the University's debt capacity. All uses of debt must comply with the University's debt policy and require prior approval. The only parties authorized to execute documents that commit Stanford to an equipment lease obligation are the Director of Procurement, the CFO, or their designees. For relevant policies, see section 1 in Administrative Guide Memo 5.1.1: Procurement Policies. Approvals, requisition processes and reporting requirements are included.\n1. Definitions and Terms\na. Leases\nLeases are contracts under which a lessee has committed to pay stipulated cash payments for the use of an asset for a specific period of time. For the purposes of this memo, an equipment lease is considered the commitment to pay for the use of an asset for longer than one year, with total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease of $5,000 or greater.\nCapital and operating leases are considered long-term financial obligations of the University. Therefore, all new equipment leases and lease renewals are considered a use of the University's debt capacity.\nb. Rentals\nCommitments not meeting these qualifications should be considered rentals that are not subject to this policy.\nc. Capital Lease\nAn equipment lease is capitalized if the total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease, excluding any transportation costs, are greater than or equal to $200,000, on a per contract basis, and at least one of the following criteria is met:\nBy the end of the lease term, ownership of the leased property is transferred to Stanford\nThe lease contains a bargain purchase option that Stanford reasonably expects to exercise\nThe lease term is substantially (75% of more) equal to the estimated useful life of the leased property\nAt the inception of the lease, the value of the minimum lease payments is 90% or more of the fair value of the leased property.\nCapital leases are reported as an asset and a liability on Stanford's financial statements and interest and depreciation are expensed. \nd. Operating Lease\nWhen an operating lease does not meet the definition of a capital lease in 1.c above, the operating lease payments are expensed as incurred.\n2. Equipment Leases\na. Approvals and Thresholds\nEquipment leases with total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease of $200,000 and above must be approved by the CFO. Equipment leases with total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease under $200,000 can be approved by managers with requisite expenditure authority in relationship to total contracted cash payments.\nb. Approval Forms\nThe Equipment Lease Approval form can be downloaded from the Gateway to Financial Activities website. \nc. Board of Trustees Approval\nEquipment leases with total anticipated contracted cash payments of $5,000,000 and above require approval by the Board of Trustees.\nd. Requisition\nFollowing budget approval, departments must submit an online requisition for the total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease to Procurement in Oracle Financials using the Standard Lease category.\ne. Lease Terms\nProcurement is responsible for negotiating equipment lease terms. Equipment leases must be signed and executed by the Director of Procurement or the CFO.\nf. Reporting Requirements\nDepartmental Property Administrators are responsible for establishing and maintaining property records for leased equipment in the Sunflower Asset Management System. Leased equipment must be tagged and tracked according to the policies of the Property Management Office. \nBy September 30 each year, departments must provide the Controller's Office with a certificate and a schedule of all equipment lease obligations to assist with the preparation of the University's financial statements and the property tax-exemption application. Reporting forms for equipment lease obligations can be downloaded from the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\ng. Return of Equipment\nUnless the department wishes to buy the equipment, a memo to Procurement is sufficient to return the item at the end of the lease. Procurement will notify the lessor.\nh. Equipment Purchase at the End of the Agreement\nTo buy equipment at the end of a lease, the department must submit a new online requisition, using the Standard Capital Equipment category and referencing the original lease purchase order number.\ni. Receiving Equipment\nThe department must inspect, verify and document the condition of leased equipment when received. Online receiving in Oracle Financials is required for leased equipment. A record for each asset must be entered into the Sunflower Asset Management System within 30 days of receipt.\nj. Insurance\nStanford's high deductible insurance coverage makes it unlikely that the University's insurance carrier would pay for any loss or damage. Therefore, lessor's insurance for equipment should cover all aspects of damage and injury. For more information, contact the Assistant Vice President of Risk Management.\nk. Change of Terms\nDepartments must observe the start and stop dates of the lease. Using the equipment outside the terms of the agreement has significant contractual implications and may subject Stanford to additional rental charges, early termination charges, and other liabilities. The lessor's insurance may be valid only during the stated period. To terminate an equipment lease early, the department must contact the assigned buyer in Procurement.\nl. Renewals and Extensions\nDepartments must submit an online requisition to Procurement to extend the duration or renew the term of a lease."}

Capital and operating lease liabilities utilize the University\u2019s debt capacity. All uses of debt must comply with the University\u2019s debt policy and require prior approval. The only parties authorized to execute documents that commit Stanford to real estate lease obligations are the Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate; the Associate Vice President, Real Estate; or their designees. For relevant policies, see section 1 in Administrative Guide Memo 5.1.1: Procurement Policies. Approvals, requisition processes and reporting requirements are included.\n1. Definitions and Terms\nReal Estates Leases\nReal Estate Leases are contracts under which a lessee has committed to pay stipulated cash payments for the use of real estate for a specific period of time. Real Estate leases are considered long-term financial obligations of the University. Therefore, all new real estate leases and lease renewals are considered a use of the University\u2019s debt capacity.\n2. Real Estate Leases\na. Background\nWhen the academic core campus becomes more space-constrained, academic and administrative units begin to look for options outside of campus boundaries to fulfill their space requirements. While physical planning on campus is centrally managed with rules and guidelines established by the University, locations off campus are subject to a completely different set of jurisdictional regulations and University policies depending upon where a particular property is situated. Prospective off-campus users should be made aware of these respective policies prior to choosing their final space destination. These policies are intended to address the political and economic realities of locating an operation or unit outside the academic core campus.\nb. Off-Campus Leasing Requirements\nAll off-campus users (whether occupying space on Stanford Real Estate Lands or not) are required to:\nConfirm their use and/or proposed construction plan confirms with the local zoning code\nUnderstand jurisdictional design and construction review and approval processes\nPay all necessary fees for jurisdictional and University approval (GUP/SIP fees do not apply)\nEngage their own resources, including leasing agent, to find space and negotiate the lease\nSelf-administer leases\nConsult with LBRE before removing property from County property tax rolls\nIf off-campus location is on Stanford Real Estate (SRE) lands, lessee will additionally be required to:\nUnderstand that lessee\u2019s direct landlord may be SRE\u2019s ground lessee and that, in those cases, SRE as well as the off-campus user are obligated to comply with the terms of the existing ground lease document\nIn all cases (whether or not there is a ground lease between off-campus user and SRE), the off-campus user must obtain SRE approval for all major improvements and exterior changes to land and buildings, as well as any exceptions to jurisdictional zoning regulations\nIf SRE is direct-owner of the building, obtain SRE approval of all interior improvements; otherwise obtain approval from direct landlord (i.e. SRE\u2019s ground lessee)\nAdhere to SRE design guidelines and/or policies for a particular location or district, if applicable (Stanford Research Park Handbook, Stanford Research Park Policy Regarding Medical Clinics, Welch Road Planning Guidelines, etc.)\nUnderstand that market rents will apply and be charged, even for SRE-owned buildings\nc. Approval Process and Thresholds\nAll real estate leases must be included as a capital request in the Capital Planning Process. The Capital Planning Process is managed by the Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate and occurs in conjunction with the annual budgeting process for the University. Departments are required to submit their capital plans for approval as part of this process. Real estate lease searches and/or negotiations initiated outside the Capital Planning Process must be approved by the Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate.\nAll real estate leases require separate approval from (1) the Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate if the total anticipated contracted cash payments over the term of the lease are under $1,000,000, or (2), the Provost if the total anticipated contracted cash payments are $1,000,000 or above. Real estate leases with total contracted cash payments of $5,000,000 and above require approval by the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees.\nd. Requisition\nPrior to negotiating lease terms, departments must submit an off-campus lease requisition form to the Associate Vice President, Real Estate. The form can be downloaded from the Land, Buildings & Real Estate website. The Associate Vice President, Real Estate will advise in the search, or direct the requestor to an approved real estate advisor.\ne. Approval Forms\nPrior to executing a lease, departments must submit an off-campus lease approval form to the Associate Vice President, Real Estate. Real estate lease approval forms can be downloaded from the Land, Buildings & Real Estate website. After approval of the lease transaction and execution of the lease, departments must request a Purchase Order or BU number from Procurement for the total contracted cash payments over the term of the lease, to ensure proper recording of the transaction and to enable payments.\nf. Lease Terms\nThe Associate Vice President, Real Estate or their designee, will assist departments in negotiating lease terms. Real estate leases must be executed by the Vice President for Land, Buildings & Real Estate, the Associate Vice President, Real Estate or their designee, or the Administrator designated by the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees. Material exceptions to standard terms must be reviewed and approved by the Office of the General Counsel.\ng. Reporting Requirements\nBy January 15 of each year, departments must provide Land, Buildings & Real Estate a schedule of all real estate lease obligations to assist with the preparation of the University\u2019s College Exemption property tax filing.\nh. Insurance\nLessor\u2019s insurance for real estate leases should cover damage to the building and premises and injury occurring in the building\u2019s common areas.

The only exception is reimbursement for mileage, where a log with odometer readings, date, destination and business purpose is used instead of a receipt. \nIf a receipt is not available, petty cash cannot be used to reimburse the expense. Instead, the expense transaction must be entered in the Expense Requests by an authorized Expense Requests transaction preparer as an expense report and the reason for the missing receipt must be provided.\nThe petty cash fund should always balance. The total cash on hand plus total receipts that have not yet been submitted for replenishment, petty cash replenishment requests in process and any uncashed reimbursement checks should equal the original amount of the petty cash fund."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/administrative-guide-policy-544-petty-cash-funds", "text": "5.4.4 Petty Cash Funds | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nNovember 02, 2015 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36.6\nThis Guide Memo outlines policy on establishing and managing a petty cash fund. It should be used in conjunction with procedural information, resources, and forms, which outline the application of this policy and may be found on the Petty Cash Administration section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website (Fingate).\n1. Overview and Purpose\nThe purpose of a Petty Cash Fund is to allow for the reimbursement or purchase of minor, small-dollar (less than $100), unanticipated business expenses, where the use of alternative means is neither feasible nor cost effective. In general, departments are strongly encouraged to use Stanford Purchasing Cards or to request reimbursement through the Expense Requests system rather than use petty cash, whenever possible. whenever possible.\n2. Principles\na. Authority\nThe Office of the Treasurer is responsible for approving all Petty Cash Fund account requests.\nb. Fund Types and Limits\nThe University has three types of Petty Cash Funds. Fund levels should be reassessed annually and modified as needed based on the volume of activity during the year.\n(1) Petty Cash Fund\nPetty Cash Funds are established for departmental use for incidental and emergency small-dollar purchases where the use of alternative means (e.g., Purchasing Card) is not feasible. Reimbursement for properly approved expenses may be obtained directly from this fund. The size of a Petty Cash Fund will be determined by the business needs of the requesting department, but will typically not exceed $500 in cash on hand, unless otherwise approved by the Office of the Treasurer.\n(2) Petty Cash Checking Account\nPetty Cash Checking Accounts may be established in departments that make small disbursements by mail (e.g. purchase of subscriptions), or that must make immediate payment (e.g. C.O.D. (cash on delivery) for goods delivered by UPS). The size of a Petty Cash Checking Account will be based on the business needs of the requesting department, but will typically not exceed $2,500, unless otherwise approved by the Office of the Treasurer.\n(3) Change Fund\nChange Funds may be established by a department, used to give change to customers when they are paying for goods and/or services, and must be reconciled daily. The size of a Change Fund will be determined by the business needs of the requesting department. A written request with the details of the business needs must be submitted to and approved by the Office of the Treasurer.\nc. Number of Petty Cash Funds per Department\nUnless the department is very large or geographically dispersed, a single petty cash fund per department is usually adequate. Reimbursements from one petty cash fund may be charged to any type of account including sponsored projects. If more than one petty cash fund is needed, a written justification must be submitted to and approved by the Office of the Treasurer.\nd. Petty Cash Custodian\nThe department head must appoint an individual to be custodian of the department's petty cash fund. Petty cash custodians must be salaried employees of the University, and may not be undergraduate students, graduate students or temporary personnel. Custodians are required to complete Petty Cash Training. The custodian remains accountable for the petty cash fund until another person is officially designated as the new custodian, or the fund is closed.\ne. Periodic On-Site Audits of Petty Cash Funds\nThe Office of the Treasurer may conduct on-site audits of selected department Petty Cash Funds, Petty Cash Checking Accounts and Change Funds each year. The funds will be selected randomly and the custodian for the selected fund(s) will be notified and an appointment to conduct the audit must be made within 72 hours. For an audit, the custodian will need to provide the auditor with evidence of reconciliations, reimbursement receipts showing the types of reimbursements being made with the fund, and provide evidence that the fund is being stored securely when not in use.\nf. Handling of Petty Cash Funds\nFailure to properly safeguard, reconcile and administer petty cash funds may lead to revocation of the petty cash fund from the department and/or disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n3.

General Procedures\na. Prompt Delivery of Gifts\nAll gifts arriving at or transferred to any part of the university should be initiated in the Gift Transmittal system by a trained user, and then be sent on the same day the gift is received to the Development Services department in the Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018. Alternately, gifts may be sent to the local development offices in the schools and departments across campus. Gifts to the School of Medicine should always be sent directly to Medical Center Development. Gifts should never be sent to the Controller's Office, Fund Accounting, or the Cashier's Office.\nFor gifts of equipment, see Guide Memo 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment.\nb. Required Documentation\nIn all cases, the university unit that has received the gift must follow these steps:\nScan all original correspondence pertaining to a gift, including the envelope and/or shipping label. The postmarked envelope will ensure the proper gift date is verified and recorded by Development Services.\nInitiate a Gift Transmittal. An authorized Gift User may go to the system and login using SUNet ID and password. Instructions are available on the Fingate website.\nComplete the Gift Transmittal form as appropriate. Instructions for authorized users are on the Fingate website.The office forwarding the gift can save the scanned documents for their records through the fiscal year, but please note that this is optional and that once posted to PostGrads, documents should be deleted from local files.\nAny questions should be directed to Development Services, (650) 725-4360 or secure-development-services@lists.stanford.edu.\nc. Donor Record Files\nThe Office of Development maintains complete donor records, including all university alumni and friends, as well as corporations and foundations that support the university. Original donor correspondence and copies of all university correspondence pertaining to gifts should be sent to the Office of Development, Development Services. The Office of Development will forward gift documents to the Fund Accounting section of the Controller's Office as appropriate.\n2. Types of Gifts\na. Cash\nDo not send cash through interdepartmental or other mail service. Call Development Services (650) 725-4360 for instructions.\nb. Checks\nChecks should be forwarded to Development Services (326 Galvez Street, mail code: 5018) immediately for prompt deposit after initiating the Gift Transmittal (see above). Holding checks results in lost interest earnings for the university and, if not cashed in a reasonable amount of time, may eventually result in invalidation. All checks $5,000 or more should be hand-carried to the Arrillaga Alumni Center or put in a secure lockbox on the Edwards building or on the Memorial Drive side of the Alumni Center for courier pick-up.\nc. Securities\nStock certificates received by a school or department should be forwarded to the Gift Securities team immediately for prompt processing. If stock certificates are received in the mail the postmarked envelope must be included so that the Gift Securities team can determine the correct date for valuing the shares and dating the gift receipt. If stock certificates are received via private courier (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, DHL), the department must include a memo stating when the envelope was received in the department. The university will, in almost all cases, sell the securities through its brokers after they are received.\n(1) Delivery of Securities\nThe transfer of securities to Stanford may be accomplished in several ways:\n(i) Broker-to-Broker Transfer: \nDonors should instruct their broker to transfer securities intended for Stanford to the university by contacting the Gift Securities team in the Controller\u2019s Office (ph # 650-721-1917, fax # 650-721-2417, email: stockgifts@stanford.edu), who will provide instructions for the donor\u2019s broker to initiate the gift transfer. A copy of any gift transmittal letter or other related correspondence should be sent immediately to the Gift Securities team.\n(ii) Mail:\nEndorsed certificates naming Stanford University (or the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University) as transferee may be sent by regular mail (certified mail recommended) to:\nBy USPS or Courier (FedEx, UPS, or other overnight delivery): Stanford University-Gift Securities Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center\nc/o Development Services \u2013 Attn: Gift Securities\n326 Galvez Street\nStanford University\nStanford, CA 94305-6105\n(iii) Hand Delivery:\nEndorsed certificates naming Stanford University (or the Board...) as transferee may be delivered by hand to any of the following locations:\nOffice of Development\nFrances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center\nc/o Development Services \u2013 Attn: Gift Securities\n326 Galvez Street\nStanford University\nStanford, California 94305-6105\nAlso:\nStanford University \u2013 Gift Securities \nStanford Redwood City Campus \n485 Broadway \u2013 University Hall (U250.12) \nRedwood City, CA 94063\n(2) Certificate in Excess of Gift\nIf a donor's stock certificate represents a greater number of shares than the number of shares the donor intends to gift to the university, then please contact the Gift Securities team for further instructions. This transaction requires special handling and several documents to permit Stanford\u2019s brokerage firm to manage the transfer and re-registration of the shares not intended as the gift. \nGift Securities team \nEmail: stockgifts@stanford.edu \nPhone: 650-721-1917\nFax: 650-721-2417\nd. Credit Cards\nDonors may charge gifts to their Mastercard, Visa, Discover Card or American Express credit cards by indicating in writing the amount of the gift, their credit card number, the date of its expiration, and their signature (as the name appears on the credit card). If a Stanford employee receives credit card information intended for a gift, they should send it to Development Services via the Office of Development courier service, fax it via the secure fax number (650) 725-0200, put the information in the one of the two gift drop boxes on campus (located at the Alumni Center and the Edwards building) or hand-carry it to the Alumni Center. Donors or staff may also call Development Services at (650) 725-4360 to make a credit card gift. DO NOT email credit card information or send it via campus mail as both of these options have serious potential for security risks.\ne. Electronic Transfers\nDonors may make gifts to the university through three types of electronic transfer.\n(1) Wire Transfer\nA donor who wishes to make a gift via wire transfer into a Stanford account must contact Development Services to obtain current instructions and to make sure the appropriate university personnel are alerted to the transaction. Instructions for wire transfers can be found here: https://giving.stanford.edu/how-to-make-a-gift/transfers/wire/\n(2) Payroll Deduction\nStanford employees may authorize a set amount to be deducted from their paychecks as a gift to Stanford. To arrange for payroll deduction gifts Stanford employees should contact Development Services, which will make arrangements with the Payroll Department. Employees wishing to change, renew, or cancel payroll deduction gifts should send a written request to Development Services.\n(3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or Direct Deposit\nDonors may authorize a set amount to be automatically withdrawn from their checking or savings accounts as a gift to Stanford. To arrange for EFT gifts donors should contact Development Services. Instructions for EFT gifts can be found here: https://giving.stanford.edu/how-to-make-a-gift/transfers/ach/ \nf. Memorial and Honorarium Gifts\nIn most cases, the university uses memorial gifts (i.e., contributions made in memory of someone who has passed away) to support the objects and purposes of the university; honorarium gifts made in honor of a special event or living person are handled in the same way. If an alternative purpose is preferred, a separate memorial or named fund may be established through the Office of Development.\ng. Gifts of Real or Personal Property\nIf a gift of real estate or an item of personal property is offered to Stanford it is important that the proper university department or official determine whether the university is able to accept it. Such decisions are made according to established university policies and guidelines according to the type of gift.\n(1) Real Estate Gifts\nThe Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, and the Director of Gift Real Estate in the Real Estate department within Land, Buildings & Real Estate should be notified of a donor's intent to make a gift of real property to the university. The Director of Gift Real Estate must first inspect the property and determine that the property may be accepted by the university. The staff in the Office of Planned Giving will then obtain any necessary Board of Trustees approval, draft requisite documents, make arrangements for title to be transferred to the university and for the gift to be credited in Development Services, and work with the donor regarding the Internal Revenue Service Form 8283. The staff in the Office of Planned Giving is available to respond to donors\u2019 tax and other related questions.\n(2) Gifts in Kind (Tangible Personal Property)\n(i) Categories\nEquipment: See Guide Memo 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment.\nArtifacts, specimens, and historical objects for departmental special collections: see Guide Memo 4.2.4: Departmental Special Collections.\nGifts of Personal Property for Resale: Gifts of personal property intended for resale should not be accepted unless it is determined that the item is appropriate for the University to resell. Examples include gifts made for the Committee for Art's Treasure Market or for a rummage sale to benefit a particular department or project. Questions about the salability of items not earmarked for a specific sales event may be directed to the Property Management Office.\n(ii) Prior Consultation\nThe Office of Planned Giving should be contacted prior to accepting gifts in kind to make sure that the donor has been apprised of tax deductibility and IRS substantiation requirements, and to assist in drafting any agreements with the donor relating to the gift. Development Services must then be notified in order for the donor to obtain a gift receipt unless previously arranged procedures have been established for the unit (e.g., University Libraries, Treasure Market) to issue its own receipt.\n(iii) Delivery Arrangements\nGifts in kind that Stanford plans to keep and use are usually delivered directly to the relevant school, department, laboratory, library, or museum that has previously approved the item's acceptance and is where the item will be housed. Preliminary arrangements may also include agreements regarding costs of packing and freight charges, which are usually the responsibility of the donor.\n(iv) Recording\nExcept for donated capital equipment, gifts in kind are not normally recorded in the donor's gift record nor in the University's accounting system; contact the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, for information about exceptions for crediting gifts in kind to a donor's record.\nh. Special Types of Gifts\n(1) Life Income Gifts\nDonors may arrange to make a gift to Stanford that will pay them and/or a designated beneficiary an income for life or for a term of years. After the death of the last beneficiary or expiration of the term of years, the gift remainder is used by the university as specified by the donor. Contact the Office of Planned Giving for further information and/or to arrange for a consultation with a donor and their advisor(s).\n(2) Bargain Sales\nUnder some circumstances, the university may provide some cash consideration below market value to a donor in exchange for a gift of real or personal property. Offers to sell art objects, equipment, securities, real estate, etc. to Stanford at a substantially discounted price should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving. The amount of the gift recorded by Development Services will be the difference between the fair market value and the discounted price.\n(3) Life Insurance\nDonors may make life insurance gifts in a number of ways:\nby naming the university as the beneficiary of the policy;\nby transferring ownership of a paid-up policy to the university;\nby transferring ownership of a policy to the university and making periodic gifts to the university to cover payment of the policy premiums. Stanford does not make premium payments from sources other than gifts intended for such purposes. The tax ramifications of life insurance gifts are complicated; questions should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving.\n(4) Bequests\nSince its founding, Stanford has derived significant and ongoing support from bequest gifts. Names of donors who have confirmed that a bequest for Stanford is included in their will or trust should be forwarded to the Office of Planned Giving along with any known details of the gift. The Office of Planned Giving operates The Founding Grant Society, which recognizes and honors those who have made life income gifts or who have indicated that a bequest to the University is included in their estate plans. Staff counsel in the Office of Planned Giving are available to consult with donors and their advisors in the drafting of bequests to the University. Information about or questions concerning any bequest gift that has matured should be immediately referred to the Manager of Trusts and Bequests in the Office of Planned Giving (650/725\u20114358).\n(5) Matching Programs\nThis section does not pertain to Corporate Matching Gifts, which are addressed below in subsection (6).\nAn important consideration with matching programs is our ability to steward gifts that provide and receive matching by ensuring that the process works correctly and in a timely manner. The administrative effort involved is significant, and we want to be certain that existing and new programs are structured in a way that can be implemented effectively. Consult with the Office of Development Finance Department if you are considering a new matching program or think a fund should qualify for some sort of match. The Finance team needs to understand the desired ratios and timing and can help to structure the program.\nMatching funds should be separated and only used for matching purposes. Please be aware that with existing matching automation, when the matching source is an endowment fund, transfers can only take place from endowment principal.\nAll new matching programs must be approved by the Vice President for Development, so please be sure you have approval before committing to a matching program with a donor.\n(6) Corporate Matching Gifts\nDonors or their spouses may work for, serve on the board of, or be retired from, a company that will match their gifts to Stanford. Donors should follow their company's procedures, which usually involve filling out a form and sending it to Stanford with their gift. Departments or other units that receive any corporate matching forms MUST forward the forms to Development Services in the Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018, and should NOT sign the forms themselves or return them to the company. Only Development Services is authorized to verify to a company that a gift qualifies for matching funds.\n3. Year-end Gifts\na. Tax-Year End\nDuring the month of December the volume of gifts to be processed increases sharply. Departments or other units receiving gifts during this very busy time of year should expedite delivery of gifts to Development Services and should take steps (described below) to verify the date of the gift so that the receipt issued by Development Services to the donor will reflect the proper date for the donor's tax purposes. The gift receipt will bear a December date even when the gift is processed in January if the gift is received in Development Services on or before December 31 or if the date is verified in one of the following ways:\n(1) Hand Delivery\nGifts may be delivered to any Stanford representative on or before December 31 in order to be treated as a gift made during that tax year. The Stanford representative should provide the donor with a signed and dated memo acknowledging receipt for securities or cash, keeping a copy to send to Development Services, 326 Galvez Street, mail code 5018, with the gift. In addition, the Stanford representative should sign or initial a notation of the date the gift was delivered directly on the check, or on the remit or any correspondence accompanying the gift.\n(2) Postmarks\nThe date of receipt for gifts received by mail is the postmark date that appears on the envelope. Therefore during December and early January it is especially important to include the postmarked envelope along with the gift when forwarding it to Development Services.\n(3) Transfers\nBroker to broker transfers of securities and wire transfers of cash must be completed and the transferred property must be in Stanford's account by December 31 to count as a gift for that tax year.\nb. Fiscal Year-End\nThe university fiscal year ends August 31. To be reflected in the university's record for a given fiscal year, gifts must be received in Development Services by 2:00 p.m. on the last working day of the fiscal year. Gifts processed later, even if dated before August 31, will be entered in the University's records in the following fiscal year. After the end of the fiscal year, requests for corrections to gift records should be made to Development Services at secure-development-services@lists.stanford.edu, who will in turn coordinate the necessary journal entries with Fund Accounting."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/administrative-guide-policy-813-provision-mobile-equipment-and", "text": "8.1.3 Provision of Mobile Equipment and Related Services\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 81.3\nThis guide memo outlines policy on the provision of Equipment/Services. The policy requires that the employee's supervisor approve the Stanford business need for Equipment/Services. The policy establishes the responsibilities of the employee and the department regarding any personal use of Equipment/Services. Schools and departments may adopt stricter provisions. The policy sets further requirements regarding the use and maintenance of Equipment/Services.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all individuals who are provided with or are reimbursed for expenses relating to mobile phones, tablets (iPad), and like equipment (\"Equipment\"), and communications services (e.g., cellular and data services and Internet services) in support of such equipment (\"Services\") by Stanford. The policy also applies to supervisors and managers who approve these arrangements.\nGroup or shared Equipment/Services such as those used for rotating on-call contact are exempt from this policy.\nMobile equipment expenses are not normally chargeable to federally-funded sponsored projects or to state-funded projects subject to OMB 2 CFR 200 \"Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements\" Research Policy Handbook Section 15.4. The Office of Sponsored Research must approve exceptions when a proposal is submitted.\n1. Background\nThe use of mobile phones, tablets, and similar devices, and related communication services by Stanford employees in the course of their work is common. Stanford often provides these devices to employees to improve communication, productivity and work efficiency, to facilitate telecommuting and remote working, working between multiple campus locations and to otherwise enhance the contributions of employees. Stanford policies generally require University property to be used only for Stanford business use. However, this policy recognizes that a portion of the use of Equipment/Services may be for non-business use, such as personal phone calls or emails.\nAs Internet service is a nearly ubiquitous household utility, similar to basic telephone service and electricity, the University generally does not provide reimbursement for home Internet connectivity. Employees who are required to have home Internet service to fulfill job requirements will be reimbursed for reasonable business use of their home internet service. Reimbursement of home internet expense, as described in this policy, must be approved by the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President, Dean, or their designee based on business necessity.\n2. Stanford Business Use\na. Stanford Business Use Required\nStanford's resources are constrained by donor, sponsor and budgetary restrictions. Expenditures for Equipment/Services must follow a strict approval process, tied to demonstrated business need, rather than as compensation in the form of the latest technological gadget. Frequent turnover of such Equipment is discouraged. The employee's supervisor will determine and approve the Stanford business necessity for providing Equipment/ Services to the employee, based upon the employee's job duties, budget availability and local policy, custom and practice. Simple convenience is not a criterion for providing mobile equipment or reimbursing related services. The approval process will include a review of all aspects of the Equipment/Services ensuring that they are provided at a minimum cost to Stanford consistent with the Stanford business requirements of the employee. \nb. Supervisory Approval\nThe supervisor (or designee) must approve the provision of the Equipment/ Services, following their customary school, business unit or department (hereinafter each referred to as the \"Department\") practice for documentation of pre-approval of a business expense. Annual review of the necessity of Equipment/Services provided to a supervisor's staff is strongly encouraged.\nc. Business Necessity\nStanford business necessity occurs when one or more of these factors is present:\nIt is vital for the mobile employee to be in constant touch with the office, lab or medical facility.\nThe employee is responsible for emergency preparedness and must be available and on-call around-the-clock for a specific business period.\nA group of employees has the need for group or shared Equipment/Services such as rotating on-call contact.\nThe employee does not have access to a landline or other communication device when doing a substantial portion of their job and communication with the supervisor or other Stanford business parties is required.\nThe Equipment/Services eliminate or reduce the need for the employee to go back and forth between the Stanford Campus and one or more Stanford Alternative Worksite (as defined in AGM 2.1.20.2.a.), consistent with University goals to reduce traffic, benefit the environment and increase employee productivity.\nProvision of Equipment/Services is the most cost-effective way to meet the business communication requirements of the employee.\nThe employee is a remote employee as defined by AGM 2.1.21.\nTelecommuting, as defined in AGM 2.1.20 does not constitute business necessity and is not a factor considered in determining whether business necessity exists.\nd. Personal Use of Equipment and Services\nProvided that the Stanford business need for the service is significant and consistent over a substantial period of time, the personal use of Equipment/Services is not otherwise limited. However, the department and the employee's supervisor reserve the right to suspend provision of Equipment/Services in the case of excessive personal use.\n3. Proper Use and Selection\na. Mobile Equipment and Service Selection\nThe supervisor will determine the minimum cost Stanford IT service plan available, and the appropriate level of Equipment to be provided, considering the features needed for business use. When a Stanford IT cell/data and/or Stanford IT internet service plan is not appropriate, the department may provide a cell/data services stipend and/or home internet service stipend in the employee's paycheck to support the business use of the employee-provided Equipment/Services.\nb. Use and Protection of University Provided Equipment and Services\nEquipment paid for by Stanford is the property of the Stanford department that paid for it. When an employee leaves Stanford or transfers from one department to another, Equipment furnished to the employee must be returned to the issuing department. It is expected that Equipment paid for by Stanford, where appropriate and feasible, will be in the possession of the employee at all times and be functional during the employee's business day. Employees must take all necessary measures to protect the Equipment from theft or damage.\nc. Laws and Policies Regulating Use of Equipment\nThe employee will be solely responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws and University policies relating to the use of Equipment/Services, including highway safety laws relating to cell phone and PDA usage, copyright laws, ergonomic use guidelines, privacy and security protocols and University export control and data security policies. See Guide Memo 6.3.1: Information Security.\nd. Preference for Stanford IT-provided Equipment/Services\nIt is the responsibility of employees and their supervisors to make sure that Equipment purchased is appropriate for the technical support capabilities of the School or Department. Stanford IT-provided Equipment/Services should be used in nearly every case. The accumulation of campus-wide purchases enhances the buying power of Stanford IT and generally provides the lowest prices possible. A large common pool of Equipment is also easier for the University to maintain and account for.\ne. Further Requirements of Particular Schools and Departments\nSchools and Departments may establish local policies and procedures to further regulate or restrict the provision of Equipment/Services in their own units, if the University-wide policy is also followed.\n4. Implementation and Exceptions\na. Cell/Data Services\nIf the supervisor has determined that the Stanford IT cell/data plan is not appropriate for the services required by an employee based on business necessity, the department may provide a stipend in the employee's paycheck to support the business use of employee-provided mobile cell/data services.\nb. Administration of the Cell/Data Services Paycheck Stipend\nTo receive a cell/data plan paycheck stipend, the Department HR Administrator may enter an employee cell phone supplement using the Supplemental Pay Webform with the Earnings Code of 'CEL'. The supplement may be entered to continue indefinitely, however, the business need for mobile Equipment/Services should be reviewed periodically by each employee's manager, or other financial staff in the business unit.\nA template request form that should be used is available at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. Employees may be approved to receive a supplement of up to $25 monthly.\nc. Internet Services\nIf the supervisor has determined that business necessity exists for the employee to have home internet service, the department may provide a stipend in the employee's paycheck to support the business use of home internet services.\nd. Administration of the Home Internet Equipment/Services Paycheck Stipend\nWith approval from the responsible manager and local senior human resources manager, or each of their respective designees, an employee for whom business necessity for home Internet service is shown may be approved to receive a stipend for reimbursement of reasonable business use of home internet service. The supplement may be entered to continue indefinitely, however, the business need for home internet service should be reviewed periodically by each employee's manager, or other financial staff in the business unit.\nA template request form that should be used for documentation is available on Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. Employees may be approved to receive a supplement of up to $35 monthly."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-312-university-funds", "text": "3.1.2 University Funds | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.1\nThis Guide Memo describes the University's funds and budgets.\n1. Fiduciary Responsibility for Fund Balances\nIndividual fund balances are controlled by the fund owner. This may be a faculty member or principal investigator, a department head, a university officer, or the university as a whole. The owner of the fund has the fiduciary responsibility for prudent management of fund balances. While at any time during the fiscal year a fund may go into deficit, by the end of the fiscal year, any fund with a deficit equal to or in excess of $1,000 in cash must be made whole by some other appropriate funding source. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the University Budget Office and the Office of the University\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.\n2. Basis of Accounting\na. Fund Accounting\nThe University maintains its accounts in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. Because the University receives funding from a variety of sources, with different types of terms and restrictions, each source must be tracked as a separate accounting entity in a unique fund.\nb. Restrictions on Use of Funds\nFund restrictions are classified differently for internal and external reporting purposes. While some of the terms overlap, they have different meanings depending on the reporting context. For external reporting purposes, the definitions are based on generally accepted accounting principles. For internal reporting purposes, the definitions are based on the use of the funds.\n(1) Internal Reporting Definitions\nRestricted: When a donor makes a gift to the University, the donor may provide terms for the use of that gift. If the terms specify a particular purpose, the funds are restricted to that purpose. Income and appreciation produced by restricted endowments is also restricted as per the terms of the endowment. Funding provided by sponsored agencies or corporations for specific grant or contract work is also considered restricted.\nUnrestricted: Funds without donor terms or with terms that allow the funds to be used anywhere at the University. If donor terms allow a gift to be used broadly within a school or unit, it is deemed Unrestricted at the unit level, but Restricted by central University administration.\nDesignated: These are unrestricted funds that have been designated for a specific purpose by the Board of Trustees or senior management. Internal units in the University can designate unrestricted resources to any number of specific purposes, but from a broader analytical perspective those funds are unrestricted for purposes of internal reporting.\n(2) External Reporting Definitions\nPermanently Restricted: The University classifies as Permanently Restricted (a) the original value of gifts donated to the Endowment and (b) accumulations to the Endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument.\nTemporarily Restricted: Temporarily Restricted assets include gifts and pledges that are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that expire with the passage of time, payment of pledges, or specific actions to be undertaken by the University or the Hospitals; these assets are then released and reclassified as Unrestricted. In addition, appreciation and income on certain donor-restricted endowments funds are classified as Temporarily Restricted until authorized for spending. Donor-restricted resources intended for capital projects are initially recorded as Temporarily Restricted and released from their temporary restrictions and reclassified as Unrestricted when the asset is placed in service. Also included in this category is the University\u2019s net equity in split interest agreements, expendable at maturity.\nUnrestricted: Funds that are not Permanently Restricted or Temporarily Restricted are treated as Unrestricted for external reporting purposes. This includes expendable gifts that have donor restrictions, so long as the University is free to spend the gift. Funds Functioning as Endowment, or FFE, are University resources designated by the Board or internal University units to be held as endowment. FFE is usually considered Unrestricted per accounting rules, as are most other expendable resources in the University.\nc. Chart of Accounts\nStanford\u2019s accounting system uses an alphanumeric code, or chart of accounts. The fund number, also referred to as the award number, is included in the chart of accounts. The University accounting system also records attributes assigned to each fund that further define the fund purpose and restrictions. For a detailed explanation of its structure, please see Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. \nThe Controller's Office, a unit in Financial Management Services (FMS), and the departments and individuals authorized to spend funds in an account share responsibility for using the chart of accounts appropriately. The Controller's Office is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the chart of accounts and for assigning fund and other account numbers. Schools and departments are responsible for communicating any restrictions on use of funds so that Controller's Office staff can set up the account correctly. Find information on the various kinds of expenditure accounts in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTAs).\n3. Fund Groups\nThe University combines funds with similar characteristics into fund groups for budgeting, planning, and reporting purposes.\na. Expendable Resources\nExpendable resources are available for the current operation of the University; balances can be accumulated for future expenditure. Sources of funds include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(1) Contracts and Grants\nFunds provided by sponsors to reimburse the direct costs of contracts and grants are restricted per internal reporting definitions. The terms of the award and applicable regulations determine how the money may be spent. To apply for a contract or grant the principal investigator for the project submits a proposal through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or its delegate to the sponsor. OSR negotiates the award with the sponsor. For more information, see the OSR website.\n(2) Tuition and Fees\nThe Board of Trustees sets tuition and fee rates. The Student Financial Services Office collects tuition and fee payments from registered students each quarter. Income from tuition and fees is unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\n(3) Gifts\nDonor gifts that are not ultimately directed to the endowment are usually considered expendable; exceptions include cases where the funds are not available for the current operation of the University, such as Pending funds and Donor Advised Funds. Donors typically specify the purpose of gifts, which will determine whether the gifts are assigned to expendable, capital, or endowed purposes. The Office of Development solicits and processes gifts to the University. For more information, see Chapter 4: Giving to Stanford.\n(4) Reimbursement of Facilities and Administrative Costs (Indirect Costs)\nThe Cost and Management Analysis Office calculates rates that are charged to each contract and grant to pay for facilities and administrative overhead costs associated with sponsored research. These costs include utilities, building maintenance, and administrative support. The responsible agency for the federal government, which for Stanford is the Office of Naval Research (ONR), approves the rates. Indirect cost reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions. Information on rate calculations and policy is available on the DoResearch website. \n(5) Reimbursement of Facilities Costs (Infrastructure and Utilities Charges)\nDesignated Funds and Restricted Funds that do not otherwise pay facilities-related costs (both Sponsored and Non-sponsored) are charged an infrastructure fee to offset operations, maintenance, and utilities costs paid by University unrestricted funds. The fee is a percentage of certain types of expenditures, and these reimbursements are unrestricted funds per internal reporting definitions. More information is available in Guide Memo 3.3.1: Infrastructure Charges.\n(6) Auxiliary Activities\nAuxiliaries are self-contained financial entities (see Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTAs)). Income is used to support operations, including overhead, and all income is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\n(7) Special Program Fees & Other Income\nIncome from outside sources related to programs, patents and royalties, program activities, affiliations, ticket income and the like are collected throughout the institution. Much of this income is subject to the Infrastructure and Utilities Charge. All of it is considered unrestricted per internal reporting definitions.\nb. Endowment Funds\nFunds in the Endowment include:\n(1) True Endowment:\nEndowment funds created pursuant to the terms of a donor\u2019s gift. These funds are generally intended to last in perpetuity. Funds established with gifts directed to the endowment are typically used to purchase \u201cpure\u201d shares in the Merged Pool, and in rare circumstances are held in assets specifically directed by the donor. True Endowment and payout from True Endowment are considered restricted per internal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose.\nThe Board of Trustees establishes an annual payout rate for distributions from the University\u2019s endowment funds. Payout may be made from True Endowment without limitation to income as long as the payout rate is prudently established and the gift terms do not provide otherwise. There is a group of funds referred to as \u201cPool A\u201d funds that are established by gifts with terms that specify something like the following: \u201cincome but no appreciation\u201d may be paid out of the fund. These types of funds are typically no longer established by the University. There are also funds that contain what are known as \u201cPool B Limited\u201d shares. This situation arises where the donor specifies something like the following: only income and appreciation above the original gift value may be paid out. These types of funds are also typically no longer established by the University. Funds without such terms of limitation are referred to in the University accounting system as \u201cUnlimited.\"Payout generated by a true endowment fund that cannot be used for operational purposes can be redirected back to the principal of the fund for investment if provided for in the donor's gift agreement, or at the request of an internal University unit. When the funds are reinvested pursuant to a provision in the donor\u2019s gift agreement, they add \u201cpure\u201d shares to the Endowment; when they are reinvested at the request of an internal unit they add \u201cquasi\u201d shares to the Endowment. In both cases, reinvestment takes place at year end unless the provision in the donor's gift agreement specifically provides that all payout be reinvested until the True Endowment fund reaches a certain level, in which case reinvestment is made monthly. All such reinvestment is subject to the same donor terms as the original Endowment gift, and is restricted per internal reporting definitions if the donor terms specify a particular purpose. Any reinvestment of unused payout by an internal University unit must be requested by July 31 for the given fiscal year.For True Endowment funds that contain Pool B Limited shares, payout is limited to income and appreciation in any year. Withdrawals in excess of income and appreciation are only permitted if that fund also contains quasi shares, in which case up to the full value of all quasi shares can be sold to make the full regular payout for that year (or as much of the full regular payout as possible). Requests for such withdrawals must be made by July 31 for the given fiscal year; refer to the form Withdrawal Guidelines for True Endowment.\n(2) Funds Functioning as Endowment (or Quasi-Endowment Funds):\nFunds Functioning as Endowment (FFE) are expendable resources (both restricted and unrestricted per internal reporting definitions) that are invested in the Merged Pool (MP) and are considered part of the University\u2019s Endowment. These are created at the request of an internal University unit (department, school, etc.). In order to create a new FFE, the unit must invest a minimum of $1 million. The minimum addition of \u201cnew\u201d money to an existing FFE is $250,000. The University\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Provost are jointly authorized to make an exception to these minimums. Requests to create FFE must be approved by both the Dean or Chair, and the school\u2019s or unit\u2019s Senior Financial Officer. Requests to approve the creation of FFE involving gift funding must be reviewed by the Office of Planned Giving.\nTo optimize investment returns, the University takes a long term perspective of its investments in the MP which requires minimal unplanned cash flow volatility in the portfolio. Thus, the MP should not be used by individual fundholders to support short term needs. Accordingly, FFE invested in the MP these funds are subject to the following guidelines:\nLock-up Periods:\nAny FFE investment made on or after September 1, 2016, is subject to a 7-year initial \u201clock-up\u201d period, during which it cannot be redeemed.\nAny FFE investment made prior to September 1, 2016 is subject to the previous 5-year initial \u201clock-up\u201d period, during which it cannot be redeemed.\nAnnual Withdrawal Limits:\nOnce the \u201clock-up\u201d period is met, FFE can be withdrawn under the following conditions:\nFFE invested on or after September 1, 2016 are subject to an annual withdrawal limit, which is the greater of: \n$5 million, or\n10% of an individual fund\u2019s market value. The 10% limit will be calculated as 10% of the fund\u2019s market value which is eligible for withdrawal at the time the request is made, less any amount that has been redeemed or is pending redemption during the same fiscal year.\nFFE invested prior to September 1, 2016 are governed by the previous FFE policy, and are not subject to an annual withdrawal limit.\nRequired Approvals:\nWithdrawals are also subject to the following approval authority:\nWithdrawals in keeping with these guidelines may be transferred out of the endowment with the approval of the school financial officer, the University Chief Financial Officer and the Provost. Smaller amounts may be withdrawn only if the remaining balance is being withdrawn.\nWithdrawals outside these guidelines are not typically allowed and extraordinary exceptions require an action of the Board of Trustees.\nNotification Periods:\nIn order to provide the Stanford Management Company with sufficient time to divest assets, requests for withdrawals must be received by Fund Accounting based on the following minimum notification requirements prior to anticipated month of withdrawal:\nUp to $150 million \u2013 90 days\n$150 million-$250 million \u2013 150 days\nGreater than $250 million \u2013 270 days\nPlease refer to the \"Investment and Withdrawal Guidelines for Funds Functioning as Endowment Greater than $500,000\" form for further details.\nReinvestment of Payout:\nEven if the amount is less than the minimum for new principal investments, at the request of the creating unit, all unused payout from FFE may automatically be reinvested back in to the principal of the fund at year end; this election can only be made upon the formation of the fund or when additions of $500,000 or more are made to the fund. If a unit chooses not to request the automatic year end reinvestment, they may contact Fund Accounting by July 31 to specify the amount that should be reinvested for the given fiscal year.\n(3) Term Endowments:\nEndowment created at the request of a donor, but intended to be fully spent down on a timeline established by the donor. These monies are used to purchase \u201cquasi\u201d shares in the Endowment. Regular withdrawals are made as per the donor terms.\nc. Non-Endowment Funds invested in the Merged Pool\nFunds in this group include, but are not limited to:\n(1) Life Income Gifts:\nA life income gift allows donors to give assets to Stanford while providing themselves or others with income for a period of time before Stanford is permitted to use the gift; until that period has ended, the gift is not counted as part of the University Endowment. The university, as trustee, manages the investment of the assets and pays a specified income to the donor, the donor\u2019s designated beneficiaries, or both. Income payments continue for the beneficiaries' lives or, in some cases, for a term of up to 20 years.\n(2) Donor Advised Funds:\nStanford has Donor Advised Funds. For more information on the size and type of gifts required to create a Donor Advised Fund at Stanford, and the amount of the fund that must ultimately be designated for the use of the University, please refer to the Office of Development\u2019s website. In cases where all or part of a Donor Advised Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it is not counted as part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund for use per the terms of the donor\u2019s request.\n(3) Pending Funds:\nThese are gifts where the purpose is pending final designation by the donor and the university. In cases where all or part of a Pending Fund is later used to establish or add to an Endowment fund, it is not counted as part of the Endowment until the funds are explicitly transferred to the endowed fund for use per the terms of the donor\u2019s request.\nd. Student Loan Funds\nStudent Loan Funds are not meant to be expensed, but rather are loaned to students as a portion of the financial aid package. As these loans are repaid, the principal and accumulated interest become available for new student loans.\ne. Plant Funds\nPlant Funds are funds that have been received or designated by the Trustees for facilities and retirement of indebtedness. They also include all of the University's investments in long-lived capital assets and related liabilities.\nf. Agency Funds\nThese are funds held for others, with Stanford acting as the custodian. Funds in this group represent liabilities owed by the University.\n4. Intermediate Pool Funds\nIntermediate Pool Mechanics\nThe Intermediate Pool (IP) functions as a unitized pool with shares and share prices, similar to the Merged Pool. The net return of the portfolio, less the cost to administer the portfolio, is allocated to the individual participating funds. Returns are not distributed on a scheduled basis, but are reinvested and accumulated in the participating funds.\nShareholder Policies\nThe Intermediate Pool is open to the following types of shareholders:\nNew Pending Funds not intended for endowment\nNew Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), or portions of DAFs, not intended for Stanford\u2019s endowment\nNew additions to the Land Development Fund\nHospital investments\nSchool and Department Funds (SDF) (e.g. The Stanford Business School Trust, Stanford Engineering Venture Fund, DAPER Investment Fund, etc.)\nIntermediate term reserves from school and units\nA portion of the Expendable Funds Pool (EFP), at the discretion of the University\u2019s Chief Financial Officer\nDebt recycling pool and unexpended debt proceeds\nOther centrally managed funds, at the discretion of the University\u2019s Chief Financial Officer\nRequests to invest school and unit reserves in the IP made by a school or academic department must be approved by both the Dean or Chair, and the school\u2019s Senior Financial Officer.\nRequests from an auxiliary must be approved by a University Vice Provost or Vice President. \nRequests from an administrative unit must be approved by the Provost.\nMinimum Investment Amounts and Lock-up Periods\nPending Funds invested in the IP require an initial investment amount of at least $500,000. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Vice President for Development. \nAll other investments in the IP, including both initial investment and additions, must be in increments of at least $1 million. Exceptions must be approved by the University\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.\nSchool and unit reserves invested in the IP are subject to a four year lock-up period, during which the school or unit may not withdraw from the fund.\nSMC\u2019s Intermediate Pool Investment Policy Guidelines\nSMC manages the investment policy of the IP with the intention of replicating the debt and equity exposure of a well-balanced global investment portfolio, investing in passive index funds.\n5. Budgeting\nEach year the University prepares a consolidated budget based on estimates of income and expenses. Budgeting enables the University to verify fund availability when processing expenditures.\na. Responsibilities \nThe Provost is the University's chief academic officer and chief budget officer. The development of the University's Consolidated Budget is a principal responsibility of this officer.\nThe Vice Provost for Budget and Auxiliaries Management directs and manages, on behalf of the Provost, the process leading to the development of the Consolidated Budget.\nBudget Officers in schools and departments coordinate all budget activities within their respective organizations in collaboration with the University Budget Office in the Provost's Office and the Controller's Office.\nThe University Budget Office in the Provost's Office maintains the budget system, approves the budget submissions of all schools and departments, and monitors and reports on variances from the approved budget.\nb. Annual Budget Process/Cycle\nThe budget process is directed by the University Budget Office.\n(1) Forecasts\nIn the spring, budget officers prepare high-level income and expense forecasts for the following year. The University Budget Office uses these forecasts to prepare the University consolidated budget forecast that they present, via the Stanford University Budget Plan, to the Board of Trustees for approval.\n(2) Consolidated Budget\nFollowing the approval of the Stanford University Budget Plan (Consolidated Forecast) by the Board of Trustees, budget officers record the final, detailed, account-by-account budget for both revenues and expenses (salary and non-salary) in the budgeting system. As of September 1, it is the official University Consolidated Budget.\n(3) Variance Reporting\nPeriodically through the year, as determined by University management, budget officers provide analysis and explanation of the variance between actual income and expense (or projected income and expense) and the Consolidated Budget in accordance with the guidelines provided by the University Budget Office. As necessary, analysis and explanation of changes from the previous fiscal year to the current fiscal year are also provided by the budget units. The University Budget Office uses this information to prepare high-level variance analysis for the Board of Trustees and University management.\n6. Fund Transfers\nFund transfers are accounting entries that move all, or a portion of, a fund's balance to another fund. The appropriateness of a fund transfer is dependent on the characteristics of the source and destination funds, including the type of fund, the restrictions of the fund, whether the source and destination fund share the same infrastructure and EFP (Expendable Funds Pool) treatment, etc. Generally, fund transfers are allowed when the characteristics of the source and destination funds conform to one another and the terms of each fund does not preclude such a transfer. These transfers are used to:\nMove money between designated funds or between restricted funds (generally transfers between a restricted fund and a designated fund are not allowed, nor are transfers to/from a sponsored project fund)\nTransfer money into or between plant funds\nAllocate and reallocate general (unrestricted) funds among budget units\nIncrease or decrease restricted funds\u2019 support of an Operating Budget account\nAuthorized central office staff typically performs fund transfers.\nAs transfer of funding creates an initial disconnect between where the funds were collected and where they were used (appropriated), strong controls and audit trails of fund transfers are required by the University and is responsible business practice."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/policy/administrative-guide-policy-191-signature-and-financial-approval-authority", "text": "1.9.1 Signature and Financial Approval Authority\nThe Stanford Board of Trustees\u2019 fiduciary responsibility for university activities includes a duty to act as a responsible steward of all university resources. This policy sets forth a framework governing the assignment of responsibility to individuals throughout the university. It is designed to provide the appropriate oversight, accountability, and transparency to ensure that commitments of university resources are executed appropriately and in accord with applicable laws, regulations and university policies. \nAccordingly, this Guide Memo contains policies governing signature and financial approval authority for execution of both financial and non-financial agreements on behalf of the university. \nThis policy applies to all university operations and projects, irrespective of physical location, except SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford Health Care and Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, and their subsidiaries and controlled entities, which are subject to their own policies.\n1. Key Definitions\na. Signature Authority/Authority to Enter into an Agreement on behalf of the University\nSignature authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to sign or otherwise enter into an agreement on behalf of the University.\nDelegated signature authority is required to sign or enter into agreements (which are inclusive of any form of written or oral contracts that create any legal obligations for the university, as further described below) or otherwise bind or obligate the university to a financial or a non-financial commitment. \nNote that signature authority for many types of agreements is reserved for specific university offices. See the Reserved Authority section for additional details.\nb. Financial Approval/PTA Authority\nFinancial approval/PTA authority is a formal delegation that allows an individual to spend or approve the commitment of university funds within the scope of their management responsibility, such as a school, department or administrative unit. Generally, this type of authority is delegated within the university financial systems (as defined below) and pertains only to the approval of transactions within university financial systems. Financial approval authority does not include signature authority as described above or other reserved authority as described below. Additionally, sufficient financial approval authority is required for all transaction approvals, including projects that have already received budget approval. An individual may be delegated financial approval authority for a specific project or initiative by the President or Board of Trustees that is greater than their normal financial authority, for example with respect to a large capital project.\nAdministrative Guide Memo 3.2.1: Responsibility for University Funds further provides that expenditures must be: (1) reasonable and necessary; (2) consistent with established university policies and practices applicable to the work of the university, including instruction, research, and public service; and (3) consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.\nc. Exercise of Authority\nIndividuals entering into an agreement on behalf of the university must have signature authority that has been explicitly delegated from the Board of Trustees or via the sub-delegation process from the President.\nWhen an action is within one\u2019s signature authority delegation, the delegate must exercise sound business judgment, including:\nConsultation and coordination with other officers, faculty, staff or other persons who may have overlapping responsibilities\nEnsuring compliance with all relevant university policies and external requirements\nVisit Fingate, the Gateway to Financial Activities website, to learn more about signature versus financial approval authority and a list of university contacts available to provide expert assistance.\n2. Scope of Signature and Approval Authority Delegated to the University President\nBy resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, the President has the general authority, on behalf of the university and its subsidiaries (excluding Stanford Health Care, Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital, and their subsidiaries and controlled entities), to execute agreements and other documents, and to approve and carry out transactions and other actions relating to all aspects of the operations of the university, except where powers are reserved to the Board of Trustees or other officers, divisions, or subsidiaries of the university by resolutions of the Board, the Board\u2019s Bylaws, the Founding Grant, law, or otherwise. The delegation to the President includes, but is not limited to, the power to:\nNegotiate and execute agreements\nExecute other documents, including government and non-government documents\nSubmit applications and reports\nSettle disputes\nAccept gifts, grants and/or other funding\nExercise investment authority other than that which has been expressly delegated to Stanford Management Company (SMC)\nCreate, maintain, operate and/or dissolve subsidiaries or other related entities of the university\nEstablish, maintain and manage bank investment and brokerage accounts and the associated funds\nAdditionally, all financial commitments (as defined below) exceeding $25 million require the approval of the Board, unless the commitment is:\nFor ordinary and necessary expenses that are required for the day-to-day operations of the university, such as wages, employee benefits, utilities, communication and data charges, insurance premiums, food services and the like\nRequired to comply with tax or other government (domestic and foreign) regulations (e.g. payments for taxes, social security, unemployment, disability insurance, etc.)\nProvided under the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) Management and Operating (M&O) contract with the Department of Energy\nProvided under investment agreements managed by Stanford Management Company (SMC) \nConstruction, renovation or building improvement projects require the approval of the Board, unless obtaining an approval may conflict with rights that have been granted under an existing agreement, if the project is on or within university-owned land, and:\nHas a financial commitment in excess of $25 million (unless the commitment is otherwise provided under SLAC\u2019s M&O contract or under investment authority otherwise granted to SMC),\nIs for creation of new development on a previously undeveloped site, or\nWill result in the change in use of an existing site\n3. Delegation from University President to University Officers, Deans and Directors\nThe President may delegate signature and financial approval authority to each Officer, Dean, and Director reporting to the President (AGM 9.1.1: President and Officers Reporting to the President) or Provost (AGM 9.2.1: Provost and Officers Reporting to the Provost). Individual officers\u2019 specific scope of responsibility and limits of specific reserved delegations are documented, retained and available for review in the Signature Authority Delegation Letter Repository on the Fingate website. The dollar limit to this authority, to the extent that it relates to financial approval authority, is documented in the university\u2019s Authority Manager System. \nFinancial commitments (as defined in the Definitions section) that are reasonably expected to accumulate, over the course of the current or ensuing fiscal year(s), to a level in excess of an individual\u2019s delegated signature authority must be treated as being outside of the limits of delegated authority. Such financial commitments must be approved by a delegate with the appropriate level of authority, if any, or by the Board of Trustees.\n4. Sub-Delegations\nWithin the scope of authority documented above for each Officer, Dean and Director reporting to the President or Provost, that individual may further sub-delegate signature and/or financial approval authority within their line of reporting, unless specifically prohibited. Such sub-delegations must also be documented, retained and available for review in the Signature Authority Delegation Letter Repository on the Fingate website.\nSignature authority sub-delegations should be limited, to the extent possible, to the next level of direct reports. All additional financial approval authority sub-delegations must be documented and maintained in the university Authority Manager system. Sub-delegations must be commensurate with the responsibilities of the sub-delegate. For example, it is generally not appropriate to sub-delegate more than half of one\u2019s financial approval authority to another individual. \nSub-delegation of authority does not equate to delegation of responsibility. It remains the responsibility of the person granting the authority to exercise appropriate oversight to ensure that sub-delegates exercise their sub-delegation with care and responsibility.\n5. Documentation\nDocumentation of all delegations and sub-delegations is retained and available online for review by anyone with a Stanford University ID (SUNet ID). To learn how to access the repository and how to request updates to delegation letters, see Signature Authority Delegation Letter Repository on the Fingate website.\n6. Reserved Authority\nRegardless of the scope of an individual\u2019s delegated authority, execution of certain types of transactions and agreements is reserved for specific offices within the university, as further described in the applicable policies referenced below. \na. Accepting Gifts on Behalf of the University\nIn general, only Office of Development (OOD) may accept gifts (e.g., cash, property, charitable gift trusts or other types of assets) on behalf of the university. In limited circumstances, individual departments (e.g., libraries and museums) are authorized to accept certain types of gifts (e.g., books, archival materials, and arts). OOD should be consulted in the gift solicitation and acceptance process as stated in AGM 4.2.1: Receiving and Processing Gifts.\nb. Construction or Remodeling\nConstruction of new buildings or remodeling involving a major exterior design change is managed through Lands, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE). Within policy, LBRE may grant approval for Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP), facility and infrastructure projects that are managed by staff within individual schools and departments; see the Departmentally Managed Projects (DMP) policy.\nc. Employment Policies\nThe Provost, for faculty and academic staff appointments, and the Vice President for University Human Resources, for regular staff and contingent positions, have responsibility for establishment of employment policies.\nd. Investments\nStanford Management Company (SMC) has signature authority for its management of the Merged Pool and the Intermediate Pool, and any other investments that it manages or administers. Signature authority related to the School & Department Investment funds is documented in individual delegation letters for the applicable School/VP Area. SMC reserves the authority to direct other pools of investment capital not managed by SMC as needed to avoid conflicts with the Merged Pool and the Intermediate Pool.\ne. Purchasing\nUniversity Procurement, within Financial Management Services, has responsibility for purchasing, placing orders and executing contracts for goods and services for the university, subject to the receipt of an approved Purchase Requisition. Procurement is the sole holder of this authority at the university, with the exception of sub-delegations that have been granted by the University President or otherwise approved by the Vice President for Business Affairs & CFO. Procurement maintains the list of exceptions as stated in AGM 5.1.1: Procurement Policies.\nIndividuals with sufficient financial approval authority may make purchases of commercially available off-the-shelf items and related services of $25,000 or less as long as the purchase does not require a signed agreement. These purchases must be reasonable and necessary, consistent with established university policies and practices applicable to the work of the university, including instruction, research, and public service, and must be consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.\nIntra-university service agreements, such as requests to university service centers for catering, maintenance or telecommunication services, are outside the purview of University Procurement and may be signed and negotiated by the applicable office and academic unit, as long as the transaction is routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA Authority.\nf. Financial Accounts and Debt Issuance\nOpening, maintaining and closing bank accounts is restricted to authorized staff members within the Office of the Treasurer (OoT). Additionally, OoT has responsibility for debt issuance. See AGM 3.6.1: Bank Accounts.\ng. Related Entities\nThe authority to create, acquire, dispose of or terminate legal entities is reserved to the Office of General Counsel and the Vice President of Business Affairs & CFO, except as otherwise provided in the applicable policy. See AGM 3.7.1: Establishment and Governance of Legal Entities.\nh. Research-Related Agreements\nThe authority to sign research-related agreements for sponsored grants, contracts, awards, and sub-awards is reserved to the Office of Research Administration (ORA), the Office of Technology Licensing (OTL), the Industrial Contracts Office, and the School of Medicine Research Management Group (RMG).\n7. Related Entities and Subsidiaries\nWith respect to the reserved authorities detailed above, if local laws, the subsidiary\u2019s corporate governance arrangements, or the university\u2019s internal policies require the signature authority or financial authority to rest with the authorized representative(s) for the subsidiary, the subsidiary and the relevant offices should determine the appropriate process to review, manage and sign agreements for such reserved authorities. Otherwise, if specified in a delegation, an individual\u2019s signature and financial authority may extend to such subsidiaries.\n8. Definitions\na. Agreement\nAn agreement is defined as any written or oral contract between the university (which includes any of its business units or related entities) and a third party that creates any legal obligation for the university. Agreements could include, but are not limited to:\nAgreements that create any financial commitment, including the potential for a financial commitment, for the university, regardless of funding source, such as purchase orders or property leases\nAgreements that set terms for acceptance of gifts and grants\nBusiness Associate Addendum\nClick-through Agreement\nCollaborative Research Agreement\nCorporate formation and maintenance documents for legal entities\nData Use Agreements\nLetters of Intent\nLicensing Agreements\nMaterial Transfer Agreements\nMemoranda of Understanding (if it contains any binding obligations)\nNon-disclosure or confidential disclosure agreements\nPermission to use the university\u2019s name\nScope of Work/Proposal\nSoftware or Software as a Service (SaaS) Licensing Agreement\nb. Financial Commitment\nA financial commitment is defined as all amounts and/or other financial value the university (or any of its business units or subsidiaries) will be legally obligated to pay or transfer to a third party during the term of an agreement.\nc. PTA\nAn acronym used for a Project-Task-Award combination representing an account in Stanford\u2019s financials system.\nd. University Financial Systems\nSystems maintained by the university for the purposes of facilitating and recording financial transactions.\n9. Special Situations\na. Internal Transfer of Expense\nInternal transfer of expense, from one PTA to another, is not subject to this policy as long as the original approval of the expense was consistent with the policy documented above. However, the journal transaction must be routed to an approver or approvers with a sufficient level of PTA Authority. Reference Administrative Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers for details.\nb. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDAs)\nThe principle of openness in research, as stated in Research Policy Handbook 1.4: Openness in Research, sets forth freedom of access by all interested persons to the underlying data, processes, and final results of research, is of overriding importance at Stanford University. Because the university\u2019s \u201copen\u201d environment is not conducive to maintaining confidentiality, generally, the university does not sign NDAs.\nPrincipal Investigators, researchers, or others (collectively \u201cRecipients\u201d) may wish to accept confidential information, materials, or technology from a third-party sponsor or supplier that requires execution of a NDA. Recipients cannot sign on behalf of the university. However, Recipients may individually take responsibility for the acceptance and protection of the information, materials or technology being shared.\nStandard NDA templates are available from Office of Technology Licensing (OTL) and Office of General Counsel (OGC).\nIf the sponsor or supplier agrees to use the university\u2019s template without modifications, recipients may sign it with no further review.\nRecipients should be aware that sponsor or supplier requested terms in NDAs may violate university policy. Therefore, if the sponsor or supplier presents their own template or requests modifications to the university\u2019s template, Recipients should consult with OSR, OTL, the Research Management Group (RMG), the Procurement Services Contracts Office or OGC prior to signing.\nc. Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOIs)\nWhile generally discouraged, in rare circumstances an MOU or LOI may be needed to advance a new relationship in anticipation of future formal agreements. \nSee the Research Policy Handbook (RPH) for the full policy statement for such agreements, including a link to a standard MOU template.\nd. Click-through Agreements\n\u201cClick-through\u201d agreements are generally used in online transactions, such as purchasing of online services or licensing of software product, where a user is required to agree to terms prior to using the product or service. Click-through agreements can be legally binding and therefore are subject to this policy. \nIf the click-through agreement creates binding obligations on the University, please review the terms before you click \u201caccept\u201d to ensure that the agreement does not contain terms that violate university policies. Examples of problematic terms include:\nTerms that involve use, license or transfer of the university\u2019s name, logo, trademark, patents, copyright, and/or other intellectual property, including for marketing or other promotional purposes \nTerms that may violate the university\u2019s policies on openness in research\nTerms that may commit the university to binding obligations that are beyond the scope of the user\u2019s delegated authority\nTerms that may conflict with the university\u2019s privacy and security policies and guidelines. For example, click-through agreements should generally not be used for services involving the storage, receipt, processing or publishing of moderate risk or high risk data (e.g. unpublished research data, student records, protected health information, other personally-identifiable information) unless the service providers are reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines.\nPlease consult with Procurement if you require assistance with a click-through agreement that may bind the university. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the university will not be bound to any click-through term or condition that conflicts with this policy or other university policies and guidelines. Also, please visit Essential Stanford Software or Software at Stanford for information on software available to use or purchase."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-521-financing-purchases", "text": "5.2.1 Financing of Purchases | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 53\nThis Guide Memo describes arrangements by which the University advances loans that are repaid over time to schools and departments to finance capital projects, programs or purchase equipment.\n1. Definitions\na. \"University financing\"\nis an internal mechanism whereby the University makes an unsecured loan (\"Internal Loan\") to a school or department to finance capital projects, programs or purchase equipment and recovers the loan principal, plus interest, over the useful life of the asset by system generated journal entries from a PTA (Project/Task/Award) or PTAs identified by the department. The authorization to borrow is documented in a Funding Agreement for projects that are approved by the Board of Trustees (BOT) and in a Form 1 for other projects. While the asset is owned by the University, the school/department retains all ownership responsibilities, including recording the equipment purchase into the Sunflower Assets System as soon as it is received and in service.\nb. \"Amortization\"\nalso referred to as debt service, is the repayment of principal and/or interest over the term of an Internal Loan. For service centers, the principal component of debt amortization payments on a project is treated as a proxy for asset depreciation expense charges and is included in the service centers' rates as such. Interest is charged and principal balances are amortized based on the prior period's ending principal balance.\nc. \"Religious Use\"\nmeans any use including services, meetings and any other activity conducted by or for a religious group or organization in a University facility.\nd. \"Private Use\"\ngenerally means the use of tax-exempt-financed property in a trade or business by any person or entity other than the borrower, a 501(c)(3) affiliate of the borrower, or a state or local government entity, and use by the borrower [or any other 501 (c)(3) organization] in an \"unrelated trade or business.\" The use does not have to result in unrelated business income to be considered private use. Private use examples may include but are not limited to: lease of university property to non-university entities; non-compliant management or service contracts (e.g., food service contracts); non-compliant corporate sponsored research agreements; naming rights arrangements with a private user.\ne. \"Substantial Completion\"\noccurs when an asset is \"placed-in-service.\" An asset is placed in service when one of the following conditions is met (in order of availability and importance):\nissuance of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO)\nsigned-off Permit,or\ncertification by a Project Manager\n2. Purchases Eligible for Debt Financing\nSchools and departments may obtain Internal Loans for academic capital projects, capital equipment purchases, service center capital projects and capital equipment purchases, auxiliary projects and capital equipment purchases, bridge financing the receipt of gift pledges and receivables, and other University programs such as the Faculty Staff Housing Program.\nOnce an Internal Loan is approved, the Treasurer's Office and Capital Accounting determine whether the project is eligible for taxable, tax-exempt, or a mix of taxable and tax_exempt debt. If the Funding Agreement or Form 1 indicates that a capital project is designated for academic purposes and tax-exempt debt is allocated to the project, it is implied that there will not be a change in use throughout the life of the project. Penalties may be incurred if religious and/or private use take place in facilities financed with tax-exempt debt. The Treasurer's Office, the Tax Director or the Capital Accounting Bond/Tax Compliance Analyst in the Controllers' Office should be notified if religious and/or private use in a tax-exempt financed facility is contemplated at any time. Questions regarding Private Use or Religious Use can be directed to the Capital Accounting Bond/Tax Compliance Analyst.\n3. Approvals\na. University Approvals\nThe Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or their designee is advised on debt allocations by a group consisting of representatives from the Provost's Office, Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE), and the Controller's Office. Certain allocations of debt may be subject to completion of a debt affordability analysis conducted by the Treasurer's Office and approval by the CFO. Financing of all capital projects requires an authorized Form 1 or, approval from the Board of Trustees (BOT) and an executed Funding Agreement. Form 1 approval procedures are outlined on the LBRE/Department of Capital Planning website. Guide Memo 8.3.1: Capital Projects, provides guidance on capital projects.\nThe BOT must review and approve increases in budgeted project costs for BOT level projects, including new building construction, projects with a total cost of $10 million and above, use of 5,000 or more new square feet within the academic growth boundary, changes in land use, and projects with major exterior design changes.\nBridge financing of gift pledges for capital projects requires prior approval from the Provost and the CFO and must be documented in a Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement addresses financial responsibility during and after construction. See Section 4.f for information on the repayment of Internal Loans, which bridge finance the receipt of gifts.\nThe Capital Accounting department in the Controller's Office is responsible for processing approval for all capital projects and capital equipment loans.\nb. Capital Equipment Approvals\nSchools may require approval from the School Dean's Office before committing to finance a capital equipment purchase.\n4. Internal Loan Terms\nThe BOT approves University debt issuances and delegates responsibility to the CFO to issue debt in the capital markets and to advance Internal Loans to schools and departments. The organization responsible for servicing Internal Loans (Paying Organization) and funding sources must be identified at the time of approval and documented in a Form 1 or in a Funding Agreement. The Paying Organization will be responsible for monthly amortization payments (interest and principal) on an Internal Loan over the remaining useful life of the asset being financed. The Treasurer's Office is responsible for the repayment of external debt.\na. Budgeted Interest Rate (BIR)\nThe University accumulates, by project, in a single fund (Single Interest Fund) all interest expense and bond issuance costs (\"Interest\") from notes and bonds issued to finance capital projects and programs that support the academic mission of the University. The BIR is the weighted average rate of all Interest related expenditures, including administrative costs, over the projected outstanding debt of the University available for project/program loans during the same accounting period (generally the University's fiscal year). The BIR is charged to the outstanding unamortized Internal Loan principal balance. Notes and bonds or other debt issued to finance activities unrelated to the academic not for profit mission of the University, or issued to finance a specific asset are excluded from the BIR calculation.\nb. Taxable Debt Premium\nIf, as a result of management decisions, the project funding structure requires taxable debt when tax-exempt debt would have otherwise been permitted, a 1% interest \"Premium\" will be assessed. The Premium will be calculated on the Internal Loan principal balance outstanding, it cannot be capitalized and will be charged directly to an operating account until the taxable debt is fully amortized. The Premium is subject to change throughout the internal amortization period. The 1% Premium will be published along with the BIR.\nc. Prepayment Penalty\nThe borrower may incur a prepayment penalty (\"Penalty\") if debt requested for the project is reduced after the Form 1 or Funding Agreement has been executed. The Premium will be equivalent to (1) interest expense on the corresponding bond obligation until such time as proceeds have been redeployed, or (2) premiums and fees incurred to repurchase the corresponding bond obligation in the open market.\nd. Exceptions to the BIR\nThe BIR is not charged to projects for which construction is in progress (CIP). During CIP and until Substantial Completion, interest on Internal Loans is added to the loan principal balance outstanding and capitalized. During CIP, the interest rate charge is the effective monthly weighted average interest rate computed by Capital Accounting. The intent is to make the capitalized interest expense included in the cost of construction, an accurate component of the total cost of the building, which is then used to calculate depreciation expense for financial reporting.\ne. BIR Calculation\nEach year in December, or as needed for the general funds forecast, the Treasurer's Office in collaboration with the Capital Accounting group develop a BIR forecast for next fiscal year's budget.\nDuring the course of the fiscal year, the Capital Accounting group compares the effective BIR with the approved BIR. The CFO determines if the variance between effective and approved BIR requires an interim adjustment. In the event of a mid-year reset, the prior months' interest expense will not be restated.\nf. Amortization of Internal Loans\nIn the month following Substantial Completion of a capital project, installation of capital equipment, or the drawdown of an Internal Loan for a program, the Capital Accounting group assesses the BIR on Internal Loan principal balances outstanding and collects principal amortization. Monthly payments are adjusted to reflect changes in the BIR, and amortization proceeds are deposited in the Recycling Pool and used for future internal lending.\nDebt service on projects financed with tax-exempt debt must be funded with current operating revenue. The Paying Organization must provide an operating account PTA to be included in the Form 1 or Funding Agreement.\nLoans for academic facilities projects and auxiliary programs amortize on monthly level payments (principal payments increase and interest decreases) over the remaining life of the asset or program.\nService Center fixed assets and capital equipment purchases amortize on a fixed principal payment schedule (straight-line amortization) over the remaining useful life of the asset, in order to mimic the asset's financial depreciation expense, which is included in service center rates.\nInternal Loans used to bridge finance the gap between construction costs and the receipt of funds, e.g., gifts and pledges, is intended to be short-term financing. Typically, pledges are paid off within three years of the project completion in accordance with a binding schedule. Bridge Financing Loan Terms: \nIf, at any time after Substantial Completion of a project, gifts have not been identified, do not have signed pledge agreements, or will not be received, the CFO will determine whether the school or department financially responsible for the Internal Loan must: \nImmediately repay the funds\nExtend or allow continuation of the bridge loan term.\nBridge Financing loans will begin amortizing in the first full month after substantial completion based on an amortization period equivalent to the asset life, with monthly level payments. Additionally, Bridge Financing loans will be fully paid off the earlier of the 60th month after substantial completion or receipt of gift/pledge payments, unless the borrowing school/department receives an approved loan extension from the CFO, in the form of a signed amended Funding Agreement.\nAny school/department funds used to pay down the loan during the amortization period may be recovered by the school/department when the pledge(s) are received, once all bridge financing has been paid down, unless otherwise indicated in the Funding Agreement.\n5. Amortization Schedule\na. Payment\nDebt service payments start one month following Substantial Completion. For example, if a project is completed during May, the debt service payment will start in June. The project will be charged capitalized interest in May based on April's ending balance. In June, the project will begin amortizing based on May's ending balance. For purchased equipment (not included in a capital project), the debt service payment starts in the month following the payment for that equipment.\nb. Interest\nThe BIR is used to calculate the interest portion of the debt service payments. The BIR may change during a fiscal year. Prior months' interest expense will not be restated. The University reserves the right to make retroactive adjustments to the BIR if required.\nc. Schedules\nThere are two amortization schedules: level payment and fixed principal.\nLevel payment\nInternal Loans for academic and auxiliary capital projects are amortized on a monthly level payment schedule over the useful life of the asset being financed. Payments are adjusted to reflect changes in the BIR. The principal component increases over time as the interest component decreases.\nFixed principal\nService Center capital projects and all capital equipment purchases are amortized on a fixed principal payment schedule over the life of the asset. Payments are adjusted to reflect changes in the BIR. The interest component fluctuates with the BIR, but the principal component remains the same and is charged straight line, over the useful life of the asset.\n6. Asset Categories and Lives\nAmortization of Internal Loans is based on the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset category or the actual useful life of the asset (e.g., asset disposal or sale). The following are amortization lives (amortization periods) listed by asset category:\nAsset Categories and Lives\nAsset Category\n\t\nLife\n\t\nComputer Equipment\t3 years\t\nVehicles\t4 years\t\nData Handling Equipment\t5 years\t\nScientific/Technical Equipment\t5 years\t\nStandard Telecommunications Equipment\t5 years\t\nIT (Information Technology) Systems\t7 years\t\nGeneral Purpose Equipment\t10 years\t\nComplex Telecommunications Equipment\t10 years\t\nFurniture\t10 years\t\nModular Furniture\t10 years\t\nShop Machinery and Tools\t10 years\t\nDedicated Special Purpose Building Space\t15 years\t\nElectrical and Utility Control System\t15 years\t\nStorm Drains\t15 years\t\nBuilding Renovations, including component Replacements\t20 years\t\nSteam and Chilled Water Utility Distribution Systems\t22 years\t\nDomestic Water and Sanitary Sewer Pipelines\t30 years\t\nNew Building Constructions\t30 years\t\nParking Structures and Lots\t30 years\t\nSteam and Chilled Water Utility Production Equipment\t30 years\t\nElectric and Signal Ducts\t40 years\t\nMajor Structures (dams and reservoirs)\t40 years\t\nCapital Improvements to a Leased space; lesser of the initial lease term or the asset's estimated useful life.\nThese amortization periods reflect specific assets' expected useful life and are generally consistent with the University's depreciable lives used for financial statements reporting. For indirect cost recovery and financial statement reporting, academic buildings and land improvements are depreciated by components, but for the amortization of Internal Loans, composite lives are used.\nFor assets not shown, or if asset life does not fall within the guidelines, please contact Capital Accounting.\n7. Capital Equipment Financing Procedures\na. PTA (Project/Task/Award)\nThe department contacts Capital Accounting to obtain the financing PTA to which the purchase is initially charged.\nb. Purchasing Standard Requisition (STD)\nThe department completes a Purchase Requisition.\nc. Repayment\nInternal Loan principal balances are amortized in equal installments, plus interest, on the remaining balance. Interest on the loan is charged in the month following the invoice for the purchase is paid. Amortization of principal starts the first month after the equipment is purchased. Debt service payments, including both principal and interest, are automatically charged monthly to the PTA(s) designated by the department (in the requisition).\nd. Reports\nInterest and principal charges can be viewed on expenditure statement(s) for the applicable PTA(s).\ne. Loan Closeout\nCharges to a departmental PTA(s) stop when an Internal Loan is paid off."}

Responsibility for University Funds\na. University Officers' Responsibility\nDeans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators, and other University officials are responsible for the management of funds in their PTAs. See Guide Memo 1.2.1: University Organization. These individuals have the authority to expend these funds to accomplish their assigned responsibilities, and are responsible for assuring that expenditures charged to their PTAs are:\nReasonable and necessary\nConsistent with established University policies and practices applicable to the work of the University, including instruction, research, and public service\nConsistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions\nFor more information on cost policy, see Guide Memo 3.1.4: Cost Policy.\nb. Delegation of Authority\nAuthority to sign expenditure documents for the purchase of services and materials on a PTA may be delegated and the University official may authorize the person to whom authority is delegated to further delegate signature authority. The University official retains accountability for prudent control of the PTA. The University official may place limits on the dollar level and the types of expenditures for which signature authority is delegated. For more information on authorization procedures, review and error correction procedures, and expenditures of restricted funds, please see the Financial Authority section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n2. Authorization Procedures\na. Authority and Required Training\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted financial approval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information, see Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford\u2019s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nb. Delegation of Signature Authority\n(1) University Officials\nA letter from University officials indicating the organization for which they are responsible and the administrator to whom they have delegated the ability to manage authority must be on file with Financial Management Services.\n(2) Delegation of Signature Authority\nTo delegate authority for both electronic and paper form transactions, the person responsible for the organization or PTA must delegate such authority via the Authority Manager.\nc. Electronic Signature\nUsers of campus financial systems identify themselves to these systems using approved, secure authentication methods. See Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems, for details on these methods. In addition to these system-independent authentication methods, financial systems may have system-specific authentication methods (e.g., a username and password for a particular system). Regardless of the authentication method, authentication using any of the approved methods is the electronic equivalent of an employee's hand-written signature and may be used as an \"electronic signature\" in electronic applications.\nd. Signature Security\nOnly the person to whom authority is delegated may authorize a transaction either manually or electronically. Disciplinary steps will be taken against individuals who are found to have fraudulently signed the name of another person, used the authentication information of another person, or divulged their authentication information to another person. The possible disciplinary actions for violations, which can include termination of employment or student status, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. User responsibilities for handling authentication information are described in Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems.\ne. Limitations on Signature Authority\n(1) Expense Reimbursement\nNo person may approve their own expense reimbursement, or the expense reimbursement of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly. Expense reimbursements, which require two signatures, must have the signatures of the person incurring the expense and the person responsible for the management of the PTA or a properly delegated agent.\n(2) Independent Review\nBusiness expenses incurred by or on behalf of the President, the Provost, a direct report to the President or the Provost, or the senior financial officer of the academic units must be approved by an independent reviewer designated by the CFO. Expenses for ordinary supplies, customarily available for all employees in an office, should be approved by a local business official and need not be routed for independent review.\n(3) Salaries\nNo person may sign any payroll/personnel form that affects their own salary, or payroll/personnel forms that affect the salary of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly.\n(4) Conflict of Interest\nNo person may authorize payment to any individual or business where there is a conflict of interest. See Guide Memo 1.5.2: Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest.\nf. Revoking Signature Authority\nThe University official who delegated authority (or the person who currently holds that position) is responsible to ensure granted authority reflects the unit's current needs. When a person with signature authority transfers to another department or leaves the University, their authority is automatically revoked. Changes for other operational reasons can be made at any time through the Authority Manager. For more information, see Quick Steps: Grant, Change, Revoke or Restore Financial Authority to Others on the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n3. Review and Error Correction\na. Departmental Review\nThe deans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators and other University officials to whom funds are allocated are responsible for reviewing their expense transactions and monthly expenditure/operating statements to assure that:\nAny expenditure is necessary and for University purposes.\nCharges are correct.\nCharges are allowable for the PTA.\nCharges are correctly coded as allowable or unallowable for inclusion in the University's indirect cost rate calculations.\nCharges are allocable to the PTA (i.e., necessary to achieve objectives of the project).\nAny allocation of costs is reasonable and equitable.\nCharges are appropriately documented, and are recorded in a consistent manner within departmental accounts.\nb. Evidence of Review\nReview of transactions is evidenced by a manual or electronic signature in the appropriate field of the form.\nc. Responsibility for Error Correction\nThe department is responsible for correction of errors. Time limits for error correction are outlined in Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.3, Cost Sharing Policy. Occasionally errors are found after the regular time limits for correction. Regardless of when the error is found, the University officer whose PTA used the good or service must pay for it, either from the same or another appropriate PTA.\nd. Central Office Review\nTo supplement (but not replace) the University official's basic review responsibility, Financial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Office of Sponsored Research review University selected expense transactions. If incorrect or improper charges are found, the reviewing office directs the person responsible for the expenditures to correct the error. If necessary, the reviewing office may correct the department's error and will provide the department with a copy of the accounting entry.\n4. Expenditures of Restricted Funds\na. Conformity to External Restrictions \u2014 Sponsored Research\nExpenditures of restricted funds, such as organized research or gift funds, whether from federal or non-federal sources, must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the agreement (e.g., grant or cooperative agreement). Expenditures of funds for federally sponsored projects are subject to the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness standards of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR 200, Uniform Guidance), and the negotiated agreements between the University and the federal government. Please see the DoResearch website for more information: http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing Cost-sharing tasks are subject to the same standards as the sponsored project that they support.\nb. Monthly Review of Charges\nFor sponsored projects and related cost-sharing tasks, the expenditure statements must be reviewed each month, as noted in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTA). The review should include areas such as those covered by the Monthly Review Guidance and Monthly Reconciliation tools. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure statement. The review must be completed within two months of the end of the month of the statement (e.g., October expenditures must be reviewed no later than December 31). Principal Investigators may delegate monthly review of expenditures, but may not delegate the Quarterly Certification of Charges (see paragraph 4.c).\nc. Quarterly Certification of Charges\nThe following certification of direct costs is preprinted on expenditure statements for sponsored projects and cost-sharing tasks each month:\n\"I have reviewed the three months of expenditures for this quarter. To the best of my knowledge, all expenditures are appropriate. Where required, corrections have been or will be made through the accounting system. I understand that to be considered timely all corrections must be made within two months of the last day of month being reviewed.\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR'S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________ \nPROJECT TASK MANAGER\u2019S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________\"\nQuarterly certification is the responsibility of the project Principal Investigator (or Co-PI). A PI may delegate the monthly review of statements for accuracy, but may not delegate certification of the appropriateness of the charges. This certification statement must be signed by the principal investigator and the project task manager. Only the last expenditure statement for the academic quarter must be signed by the principal investigator and Project Task Manager. The quarterly certification must be completed within two months of the end of the academic quarter being certified, as described in the Monthly Review and Quarterly PI Review Certification. This signature means that the principal investigator has reviewed all direct charges to the project and that either the charges on the expenditure statement are reasonably accurate as shown, or that the appropriate individual in the department has initiated accounting entries to correct any differences. Review and correction of differences must be completed within the deadlines outlined on the DoResearch site.\nd. Record Retention\nThe certified expenditure statements must be retained in the department files for future review by government and University auditors in accordance with University record retention requirements for sponsored projects (see Guide Memo 3.1.5: Retention of Financial Records.\n5. Expenditures of Gifts\na. Conformity to Donor Restrictions \u2014 Gifts\nGifts, which typically differ from sponsored projects in that they do not require a detailed scope of work, budget, or period of performance, may on occasion have restrictions on the use of funds (to ensure the use is consistent with the donor\u2019s original, accepted, stipulations). If this is the case, the University must take care to allocate the funds to the academic area, group, department, faculty member or other University activity as stipulated. While the academic area or faculty member may have broad discretion over the specific expenditures of support, the donor may expect a report on the general uses of funds donated or even a report on line-item expenses. Donors do not typically recoup gift funds, but if a gift made for a restricted purpose has not, however, been spent according to the donor\u2019s restrictions, a donor may have grounds to rescind and recoup the gifted funds.\nb. Gifts to Stanford made by Faculty, Staff, Spouse or Family member\nTo ensure compliance with regulations governing charitable contributions and to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, gifts made to Stanford by Stanford faculty, staff, spouse or family member: \nShould be placed in a unique account so that the source and use of the gifted funds can be clearly identified.\nMay not be placed in accounts under the control of the donor (e.g. neither the donor, nor any individual reporting to the donor, may have signature authority over the account).\nMay not be used to fund travel, purchases, or any other expense that could be construed by others to benefit the donor for purposes unrelated to their work for the University.\nMay not be used to fund the salary of the donor.\n6. Sources for More Information\nCognizant Office\nFinancial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Research Financial Compliance and Services (RFCS) office are available to answer questions about expenditure authorization. For contact information, see the Gateway to Financial Activities website or the DoResearch website."}

Definition\nAn \"out-of-state employee\" is defined as an employee of Stanford University whose primary work site is located outside the state of California. All individuals defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions, are considered employees for the purpose of this Guide Memo. Consultants and contractors are not covered by this Memo.\n2. Policy\na. Applicable laws\nEmployees outside the state of California and Stanford University as their employer are subject to all employment-related laws of the state or foreign nation in which they work.\nState taxes, employment tax, and workers compensation provisions vary from state to state. University Payroll is primarily responsible for compliance with these various rules. Therefore, departments must notify Payroll immediately of any prospective arrangements involving Stanford employees outside the state of California by submitting a HelpSU ticket (Category: Financial Management, Request Type: Payroll).\nThe existence of Stanford University employees in a state outside California may trigger additional compliance requirements besides those relating to employment. Therefore, the hiring or reassignment of employees to positions outside California must be supported by an important University business purpose and not be merely an accommodation to the employee.\nb. Approval\nApproval of the hire or reassignment must be obtained in advance in writing from the responsible Vice Provost, Vice President (or similar level equivalent to the highest administrative person within the organizational unit), or their designee, identifying the key University business reasons for the assignment.\nc. Payroll\nNotify University Payroll of the out-of-state assignment in advance of the start of work outside of California by sending a completed Approval of Out-of-State Employee Approval form to the Payroll Office.\nd. Administrative costs\nAdministrative costs per capita for out-of-state employees are high due to the extraordinary costs to assure compliance and, in some cases, liability for unemployment and disability benefits. Therefore, a one-time $500 fee is charged to the assigning department for each new out-of-state employee on payroll, to be assessed when the assignment begins. Departments are also charged $200 each year for each out-of-state employee. Failure to report out-of-state employees to University Payroll in a timely manner may result in compliance penalties, which will be assessed to the assigning department.\ne. Benefits\nThe choices of health and welfare benefits plans may be more limited for employees who work outside of the Bay Area. You can find more information at https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards.\nf. When Employee Works in California\nNotify University Payroll of any days that the out-of state employee is present in California on Stanford business. Compensation earned on such days is considered California-sourced taxable income regardless of employee\u2019s state of residence and is subject to all California tax provisions. Use the Report of Days Worked in California for Out-Of-State Employees form to report annually the number of days an out-of-state worker works in California.\n3. For More Information\nContact University Payroll by submitting a HelpSU ticket (Category: Financial Management, Request Type: Payroll)."}

Professoriate\nThe Professoriate consists of the tenure line professoriate, the non-tenure line professoriate, and the Medical Center Line. Appointments to the Professoriate require approval by the department chair, school dean, Provost, Advisory Board of the Academic Council, and the President of the University.\na. Tenure Line Professoriate\nProfessor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor. Members of the Tenure Line Professoriate are members of the Academic Council. Professors are normally appointed with tenure; i.e., without limit of time. Associate Professors may be appointed either for a term of years or with tenure. Assistant Professors are appointed for a term of years. Individuals appointed to the rank of Assistant Professor with a \"Subject to Ph.D.\" contingency are not members of the Academic Council until official confirmation of completion of Ph.D. requirements is received.\nb. Non-tenure Line Professoriate\nProfessor or Associate Professor followed by the parenthetical designation (Performance), (Research), or (Teaching); Assistant Professor (Research); and Professor (Applied Research). The \"Performance\" designation is used in the fine arts and \"Applied Research\" at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC). Members of the non-tenure line professoriate are members of the Academic Council.\nc. University Medical Line\nProfessor, Associate Professor, or Assistant Professor of \"Subject\" at \"a specified Medical Center,\" such as the Stanford University Medical Center or the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford. Faculty in the University Medical Line are voting members of the Faculty Council of the Medical School but are not members of the Academic Council. They are eligible to vote on departmental and school matters according to departmental and school policies, and to serve on faculty committees, except for those specifically reserved for Academic Council members.\n2. Academic Appointments in Specified Policy Centers and Institutes\na. Senior Fellow\nSenior Fellows at specified policy centers and institutes are members of the Academic Council. Their appointments are for a specific period of time or for a continuing term (subject to programmatic need and/or funding) and are not in the tenure line. (Note: Senior Fellows at the Hoover Institution are not members of the Academic Council. Their appointments require different procedures.)\nb. Center Fellow\nCenter Fellows are not members of the Academic Council. Appointments are for a specific period, renewable, and contingent on programmatic need and/or funding.\n3. Academic Staff\nNon-professorial academic staff is comprised of the teaching staff (Lecturers, Senior Lecturers, Advanced Lecturers, and Artists-in-Residence), research staff (Research Scientists, Senior Research Scientists, Senior Research Engineers, Senior Research Scholars), and professional library staff (Librarian 1, Librarian 2, Librarian 3, Librarian 4, Library Manager 1, Library Manager 2). These appointments are made for a specific period of time, for a continuing term (subject to satisfactory performance, programmatic need, or financial support), or for the duration of an administrative appointment or project. Procedures for Academic Staff-Teaching appointments are established by the Provost's Office. Procedures for Academic Staff-Research are established by the Office of the Dean of Research. Academic staff are not members of the Academic Council.\n4. Other Teaching Titles\nAppointments to the following positions require approval of the department chair and school dean. These appointments may be for a specific period of time or for a continuing term (subject to programmatic need and/or funding), with or without salary, and for various percentages of time.

Postdoctoral Scholars, Postdoctoral Fellows and Postdoctoral Research Affiliates (Postdocs)\nA Stanford postdoctoral scholar is a non-matriculated trainee, in graduate student status, in residence at Stanford University pursuing advanced studies beyond the doctoral level in preparation for an independent career. Postdoctoral Scholars are appointed for a limited period of time and may participate on Stanford research projects and/or may be supported by external awards or fellowships. In all cases, their appointment at Stanford is for the purpose of advanced studies, research, and training under the mentorship of a Stanford faculty member. For more information, see the Research Policy Handbook.\n6. Visiting Scholars\nGuests of the University who are pursuing individual research or other scholarly activities. Visiting scholars must hold a doctoral degree (or be a recognized expert in their field) and be from an outside institution or organization. \"Visiting scholars\" do not receive compensation or benefits provided for students, faculty, or staff. They are sponsored by schools or academic departments and have certain courtesy privileges.\n7. Staff Employees\nIndividuals on the University payroll who are not Stanford students, faculty, academic staff, other teaching staff or postdoctoral research affiliates. \"Staff employees\" are subject to appointment procedures and terms set forth in memos of the Administrative Guide or applicable collective bargaining agreements. SLAC Senior and Distinguished Scientists and Engineers are regular staff employees subject to the terms set in the Administrative Guide memos. In addition, Clinician/Educators and Instructors are staff employees subject to the terms set in the Administrative Guide memos except that procedures for appointments, pay, time off with pay, and grievance review are established by the Dean of the School of Medicine.\nFor more information about Clinician/Educators and Instructors, see:http://med.stanford.edu/academicaffairs/faculty.html\n8. Regular Employees\nEmployees have \"regular\" status when appointed at 50% FTE or more for at least six consecutive months, or as described in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Regular status is a requirement for most health and welfare benefit plans and programs. In the Administrative Guide, \"benefits-eligible\" refers to regular employees who are eligible for University sponsored health and welfare benefits.\n9. Casual Employees\nEmployees on the University payroll appointed less than 50% FTE and work no more than 980 hours during the calendar year for all job assignments. [Note: Departments may elect a discretionary limit of less than 980 hours based on their business need.] Once a casual employee reaches the 980-hour limit, the position should be posted and filled as a regular, benefits-eligible employee on the University payroll for any further work in the same calendar year. An individual should not be hired or rehired into a casual position if it can reasonably be anticipated that the assignment will result in the employee working 980 hours or more in a calendar year as a casual (or temporary) employee.\n10. Temporary Employees\nEmployees on the University payroll appointed at 50% FTE or more for no longer than six consecutive months and work no more than 980 hours during the six-month period for all job assignments. [Note: Departments may elect a discretionary limit of less than 980 hours based on their business need.] Once a temporary employee reaches the 980-hour limit, the position should be posted and filled as a regular, benefits-eligible employee on the University payroll for any further work in the same calendar year. An individual should not be hired or rehired into a temporary position if it can reasonably be anticipated that the assignment will result in the employee working 980 hours or more in a calendar year as a temporary (or casual) employee.\nImportant Notes on CASUAL and TEMPORARY Employees:\nIf duties are technical, maintenance, or service, employees may be appointed at 50% FTE or more for no longer than four consecutive months.\nTemporary and casual employees are not regular employees. Temporary or casual employees are considered \"at-will\u201d for the duration of their employment. This means that employment can be terminated by either the employee or the university at any time and for any reason, or no reason, with or without notice.\nAn individual may be hired in a regular benefits-eligible position at any time after reaching the 980-hour maximum, as long as their meets all employment requirements. Admin Guide Memo 2.1.2: Recruiting and Hiring of Regular Staff, outlines information about employment preference provided to temporary or casual staff.\nTemporary and casual employees are not guaranteed a particular number of hours per week or duration of assignment.\n11. Stanford Student Employees\nEmployees who are registered Stanford students have \"student\" status excepting those whose employment is totally independent of and unrelated to their Stanford student role. Stanford students who are not currently registered are considered casual or temporary employees.\n12. Exempt Employees\nAll University employees, including students, faculty, and staff are subject to federal and state requirements regarding minimum wages, payment for overtime work, and related record keeping. However, employees may be exempt from the overtime pay and record keeping requirements when they occupy bona fide professional, managerial, or executive positions. At Stanford, \"exempt\" positions typically include executive officers, faculty, academic staff, other teaching staff, and certain professional, administrative, and executive staff. The Vice President of Human Resources, in accordance with provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor determines exempt status.\n13. Non-exempt Employees\nThese are the employees who are not \"exempt\" under federal and state overtime regulations. They must receive compensation for overtime work.\n14. Salary Basis of Compensation\nA \"salary,\" as distinguished from an \"hourly wage\" is compensation established by the month (e.g. $1,000 per month) with the amount remaining the same each month without regard to the variations from month to month in the normal number of working hours (e.g., in 2010 a salaried full-time employee received the same salary for January with 184 working hours and for February with 160 working hours.)\n15. Hourly Basis of Compensation\nCompensation established on an hourly basis, so that pay varies with the actual number of hours worked (or on paid leave) in each pay period.\n16. Pay Period\nEach month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls on or immediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.\n17. Staff Benefits\nPlans and programs made available by the University for the benefit of faculty and staff. Included are legally required programs such as Social Security and short-term disability insurance, as well as University programs such as health plans, personal and life insurance, disability income plans, education and training plans, retirement income plans, and recreation facilities.\n18. Term (Duration of Employment)\nAll faculty and staff have one of the following appointment terms:\na. Continuing\nWithout a specified duration or time limit.\nb. Fixed-term\nAppointment is for a fixed duration with a specified ending date. Such appointments can be ended prior to the designated end date consistent with the policies applicable to each specific employee classification.\n19. Base Pay\nBase Pay is the hourly rate or monthly salary paid for a job performed. It does not include any premium pay, e.g., overtime, shift differentials, supplemental pay, or any pay element other than the base rate.\n20. Regular Pay\nRegular Pay is the hourly rate or monthly salary paid for a job performed, including any premium pay, e.g., shift differentials, supplemental pay, or any pay element other than the base rate."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-322-cost-transfers", "text": "3.2.2 Cost Transfers | Administrative Guide\nSkip to main content Skip to secondary navigation \nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJuly 26, 2022 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 38\nThis Guide Memo sets out policies and procedures for transferring already incurred costs from one expenditure account (Project-Task-Award) to another. Cost transfers may also be called transfers of expense.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all Stanford employees responsible for financial analysis and management of expense transactions.\n1. Cost Transfer Policies\nA cost transfer is an after-the-fact reallocation of the cost associated with a transaction from one Project-Task-Award (PTA) to another. Although costs should always be charged to the correct PTA, cost transfers are sometimes necessary. To be allowable, cost transfers must be timely, be fully documented, conform to University and sponsor allowability standards (that is, allowable under the terms of the sponsored agreement), and have appropriate authorizing signatures. See Guide Memo 3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures.\na. Error Correction\nCorrection of errors is required on all PTAs. Errors may include clerical errors (such as typographical errors or transposition of digits in the PTA and expenditure types). Other errors may be detected upon review or certification of monthly expenditure reports. It may be that an employee's Labor Schedule was not updated, an individual's effort was redirected, or a purchase was charged to a PTA other than the one that ultimately benefited from the use of the items purchased. All errors should be corrected as soon as they are detected.\nb. Active Sponsored Project PTAs\nRefer to Cost Sharing in the Research Policy Handbook, Section 15.3. In addition to deadlines, it addresses:\nDocumentation\nSponsor requirements\nPre-award costs\nCosts benefiting more than one project\nOverdrafts\nc. Documentation\nOnline cost transfer documentation must clearly show:\nThe expense directly benefits the receiving PTA\nThe expense is allowable on the receiving PTA\nThe reason the expense was charged incorrectly to the first PTA\nThe allocation methodology used if transferring expenses to multiple PTAs\nThat any systematic reasons which might cause this problem to be repeated have been addressed\nThe reason for any delay in the timely processing of the transfer\nd. Cost Transfer Deadlines\nCost transfers should be prepared and submitted as soon as the need for a transfer is identified, and should be completed no later than six months after the cost is posted. Transfers submitted after the deadline must include a valid reason for the delay, and will generally not be allowed to be transferred onto a sponsored project. When transfers are delayed, a correction to the original source of an entry (e.g., an update to a Labor Schedule) may not be made timely. Therefore, care should also be taken to ensure that subsequent charges are either appropriate to the original PTA or also transferred.\n2. Cost Transfer Procedures\na. Getting Started\nCost transfers are submitted using the university\u2019s Oracle Financials iJournals and Labor Distribution Adjustments systems. For information about accessing and using these systems, see Learn About iJournals and Learn About Labor Distribution Adjustments on the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nNew iJournals are used to transfer all costs with the exception of salary or student aid expenses that were originally posted on or after September 1, 2003\nHistorical iJournals are used to transfer any expenses (including salary and student aid expenses) that were originally posted before September 1, 2003\nSalary iJournals are used to transfer salary expenses originally incurred (determined by the expenditure item date) on or after September 1, 2003 and before April 1, 2005.\nLabor Distribution Adjustments are used to transfer salary expenses originally incurred after March 31, 2005\nAllocation iJournals are used to distribute costs based on proportional benefit to a project. Allocations are used when it is difficult to determine in advance how much to charge each PTA for a shared supply or service. Allocations are often used to distribute costs from Service Centers, Auxiliaries, or expenditure allocation PTAs. Often allocations are repetitive, or are required on a repetitive basis.\nb. Authorization Requirements\nAll users of university financial system must have an active SUNetID and password.\nFinancial transaction preparers and approvers must be granted appropriate authority privileges using the Authority Manager system and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information, see Authority to Create Financial Transactions and Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford\u2019s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nc. Signatures\nOnline signature of the person responsible for approving the Project-Task/Award to be debited is required for most iJournal types. Online signature for the Project-Task/Award to be credited is required for Allocation iJournals. In all cases, the department initiating the transfer should make sure all individuals responsible for affected PTAs are informed of the entry."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/ground-transportation", "text": "Ground Transportation\nIndividuals traveling on university business are expected to use transportation options that are necessary and reasonable. Non-local travel will usually consist of a combination of air and ground transportation. Ground transportation is likely to be required as more than one component of a trip (e.g., travel from home to the airport, travel from the airport to lodging, travel from the airport to home, etc.). When planning and requesting approval for university-related business travel, the traveler should consider all aspects of the total trip to achieve the most economical result.\nTransportation Options\nFor travel of 350 miles or less round trip, ground transportation by private car, bus, shuttle service, ride service, taxi, rental car or some combination of these is likely to be the most economical. The traveler may still fly to a location that is less than 350 miles round trip if it is more economical.\nFor travel in excess of 350 miles round trip, commercial air travel is generally the most economical and practical; however, other forms of travel such as bus, rail or ship, may be allowed in certain circumstances and should include an explanation and supporting documentation for why that option was selected. For more information about documentation and reimbursement for ground transportation beyond 350 miles round trip, see the Fare Comparisons section below.\nLocal Transportation \nThe university will not pay or reimburse the cost of transportation (such as a private sedan, a limousine (limo), rideshare services, or other car services) used to travel on, around or between campuses.\nTips\nVisit the Business and Travel Expense Policies page for guidance on tips.\nMost Direct Route\nThe traveler should use the most direct route for ground travel. If, for other than university business, the traveler takes an indirect route or interrupts a direct route, payment for transportation expenses will be at either the actual charge or the expense that would have been incurred by traveling the direct route by the most economical means, whichever is less. The expense that would have been incurred as the most economical and direct route must be documented in the expense report.\nFare Comparisons - Bus, Rail, Ship, Etc\nWhen a bus, rail or a commercial vessel is selected, the university will pay the reasonable and necessary cost of the lowest fare available for the trip. Reasonable and necessary fares typically include coach or economy classes. Other classes of travel may be allowed based on documented medical needs by submitting a medical waiver request. This form must be updated each fiscal year, unless it explicitly states it is for a long-term condition, in which case it will be valid for five years. Confidential medical information per HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) should not be included in the contents of the request. All other requests for the use of other classes of fare must be pre-approved by the traveler\u2019s dean\u2019s office or senior financial approver, and this approval must be documented in the expense request.\nWhen the most economical method is not selected for a trip over 350 miles--for example, when rail, bus, ship, personal vehicle or rental car are selected in place of commercial air travel--the university will reimburse for that travel up to the lowest available commercial airfare available for the same trip, and the traveler is required to provide fare comparison documentation. \nThe fare comparison documentation is most often in the form of a screenshot of Stanford Travel of search results taken the same day of booking from a Stanford Travel booking channel. The screenshot must visibly note the time and date of the search (i.e., from the taskbar on your desktop); include a broad set of search results (e.g., all applicable carriers); and should display the applicable parameters, such as the most direct route, excluding any personal stops and the appropriate fare class (e.g., coach, non-refundable). The expense report must include an attachment with the fare comparison documentation.\nIf the attached screenshot date is post-travel, the Business Expense team will calculate an online comparison at the time of processing, and will pay based on the lesser of their own comparison or that provided by the traveler. Refer to How to: Document a Flight Comparison for more information.\nCommuting Expenses\nThe university will not pay employees for commuting expenses between their home and regular worksite. If an employee has a temporary assignment away from their regular worksite, payment will be made for the expense of ground transportation between their regular worksite and the assignment location or between home and the assignment location, whichever is less.\nTravel Companions\nIn general, the expenses of a spouse, family member or other person accompanying the business traveler are not reimbursable. Such expenses are only allowed if the accompanying person has a position with the university, and is traveling to make a significant contribution in furtherance of university business. Exceptions to this policy are rare and must be approved in advance of travel by the Provost.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nIt is the responsibility of the individual incurring the ground transportation expense and those involved in the booking, preparation and approval of the expense request or financial transaction to exercise good stewardship of university funds and to adhere to university policies. The individual incurring the expense and the appropriate administrator must ensure that all costs are in compliance with university travel and business expense policies prior to purchasing. These roles and responsibilities are outlined in Reimbursements & Expense Requests."}

If you would like assistance with this process, contact your local HR Team. To use a simpler process, use the CardinalTemps system, in which the vendor manages background checks, salaries, timecard instructions, worker's compensation, etc. \n1. Determine What Type of Hire is Required\nEMPLOYEE TYPEDESCRIPTIONADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nTemporary employee\t\nEmployees on the university payroll or an external agency appointed at 50% FTE or more for no longer than six consecutive months and work no more than 980 hours during the six-month period for all job assignments.\nIf duties are technical, maintenance, or service, employees may be appointed at 50% FTE or more for no longer than four consecutive months.\nCardinalTemps is the preferred one stop solution for hiring temporary labor at Stanford through an external agency.\nThe program is administered in partnership with PRO Unlimited, a managed service provider (MSP), that oversees the requisition and candidate fulfillment process. \n*Introduced in April 2018, this new program does not affect temporary workers hired directly onto Stanford's payroll or independent contractors (hired directly or through a temporary agency). \n\t\nAdministrative Guide Memo 2.2.1\n\t\nStudent employee\t\nGraduate or undergraduate Stanford students who are hired for part-time work.\nThese students are hired into Peoplesoft using an \u201cSU\u201d job code. \n\t\nAdministrative Guide Memo 10.1.1 (Undergraduate Students)\nAdministrative Guide Memo 10.2.1 (Graduate Students)\nStanford Financial Aid website\n\t\nCasual employee\tEmployees on the university payroll appointed less than 50% FTE and work no more than 980 hours during the calendar year for all job assignments.\tAdministrative Guide Memo 2.2.1\t\n2. Determine Compensation\nSee your HR manager or representative for assistance with temporary and casual employee compensation. He or she can help you interpret staff compensation guidelines set forth in the Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.5: Compensation of Staff Employees. \nLocal Management of Temporary, Casual and Student Employee Compensation\nHR managers oversee the hiring and pay of temporary and casual employees in their local areas. Some schools/areas may determine a more closely controlled local process is needed; others may determine a decentralized process works well.\nHR managers should refer to the Temporary and Casual Employee Compensation System located in the HRM Toolkit (secure login required) for information on the current year\u2019s program.\n3. Partner with Your Local HR Team to Make Verbal Offer to Final Candidate and Send Offer Letter\nPresent a verbal offer to the final candidate. Inform the final candidate a written, contingent On Assignment Letter will be extended upon acceptance of the verbal offer.\nOn Assignment Letters are accessible by your local HR Team only. Contact your local HR Team to obtain the offer letter to send to your final candidate. Once the On Assignment Letter is sent, ensure your local HR Team receives the signed copy for the new hire's personnel file. \n4. Initiate Background Check Through Your Local HR Team\nA background check can only be initiated after a written conditional job offer is made. Continue to work with your local HR Team to launch the background check.\nNOTE: Most student employees do not require a background check. If hiring a student employee, please verify with your Human Resources manager if a background check is required.\n5. Instruct the Candidate to Provide Birth Date and SSN to Local HR Team\nBirth date and SSN are needed for new hires only, and not required if the candidate was previous employed at Stanford. Do not have them send this information by email. Instead, please instruct the final candidate to complete the Stanford Secure Hiring Privacy Portal to collect the birth date and social security number. \nNOTE: Student and Work-study Student hires are excluded from this step.\n6. Complete Hire Form\nComplete and send the Temp/Casual Employee Hire Form with approvals along with the resume and Employment Application to your local HR Team.\nHR will process the new hire into PeopleSoft. Allow one to two business days for processing.\nDo not sponsor a SUNet ID for the employee prior to HR entering the employee into the system. This will prevent creating a duplicate Employee ID.\nNOTE: Resume and SU Employment Application are not required for student or work-study student employees.\n7. Complete Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) For New Hire\nDepending on your local policy, ensure that either you or your local HR Team completes the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) for the new employee within three days of the date of hire.\nThe completed I-9 form and the supporting documents need to be sent to Payroll (ID Mail Code 8440) within the three day time frame to meet the Homeland Security compliance deadline.\nThis is needed for all new hires and rehires (if there is a break in service). \nNOTE: Student and Work-study Student hires are not excluded from the I-9 requirement.\nVisit the Fingate website for more information on completing the I-9\nDownload the I-9 Form"}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/administrative-guide-policy-223-university-payroll", "text": "2.2.3 University Payroll | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 35\nThis Guide Memo contains general policies concerning the university payroll. SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) currently applies the applicable policies contained herein. SLAC departments should consult SLAC Business Services Division for SLAC procedures.\n1. Employer/Employee Relationship\nWhether an individual is a university employee or an independent contractor is a determination with important practical and legal consequences.\na. Definitions of Employee and Independent Contractor/Consultant\nFederal tax rules define an employee as an individual who performs services subject to control by an employer both as to what services shall be performed and how they shall be performed. If the university has the legal right to control both the method and result of services, that person is considered an employee and therefore subject to income tax withholding. By contrast, for independent contractors (sometimes called consultants), the university does not control where and how the work is performed but only receives a final deliverable. Independent contractors or consulting firms should be procured through the procurement contract process on the Fingate website. For more information, refer to IRS guidance at Employee or Independent Contractor Status. If the person and/or work being performed do not legally qualify for Independent Contractor status, hiring the person as a contingent worker may be the appropriate option.\n2. Employment Categories\nEmployees are categorized within the payroll system according to the length of the appointment, the percentage of time worked, and the type of position they fill. These categories in combination affect eligibility for most employment benefits.\na. Length of Appointment\n(1) Continuing\nContinuing employees are expected to remain on the payroll for six months or more (four months or more for Bargaining Unit employees).\n(2) Temporary\nTemporary employees are expected to remain on the payroll for less than six months (less than four months for Bargaining Unit employees). Stanford students working less than 50% time may be appointed for the entire academic year as temporary employees. Temporary employees are not eligible for employment benefits.\nb. Scope of Appointment\nThe percentage of a full-time equivalent position (% FTE) an employee works affects both eligibility and level of benefits. See Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions for the % FTE of a continuing appointment that grants \"regular employee\" status and eligibility for most benefit plans and programs.\nc. Type of Position\nThe job classification defines whether the position is:\n(1) Salaried or Hourly-Paid\nSalaried employees are paid their semi-monthly salary (less authorized deductions) every pay period unless an exception (such as authorized overtime hours or leave without pay) is reported. Subject to exceptions, the gross salary amount of the paycheck is the same for each pay period, regardless of the number of working days in the period.\nHourly-paid employees are paid for actual hours worked (less authorized deductions) as shown on a timecard submitted for the pay period.\n(2) Exempt or Non-exempt\nSee the definitions in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. Employees who are exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act are not paid overtime.\n3. Compliance with Employment Law\na. Documentation of Eligibility for Employment\n(1) Completing Form I-9\nAll new and rehired employees must complete a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9 by the end of the day on their first day of (re)employment, and provide appropriate original document(s) to establish identity and work authorization. The hiring department, or other university designee, must review the original document(s) and complete the employer portion of this form within three business days of the first day of employment. Employers cannot specify which document(s) the employee must present. Completed forms are submitted to Payroll for review and document retention.\n(2) Updating Form I-9\nEligibility to work in the U.S. may expire for certain types of temporary visitors. Documentation of continued eligibility to work must be provided before the work eligibility expiration date.\n(3) Re-verifying Form I-9\nA new or re-verified Form I-9 must be completed after any break in employment. Certain exceptions apply for instructional staff/faculty, student, or seasonal/temporary employees returning to the same job in the same department following an expected break in employment of less than one year. See Topic Overview: Verify Eligibility for Employment and Form I-9 on the Fingate website for detailed guidelines. \n(4) Failure to Complete/Update Form I-9\nFailure to comply with USCIS Form I-9 requirements will result in ineligibility for employment and/or immediate termination.\nb. Tax Requirements\n(1) Withholding Tax Information\nNew employees must complete a withholding declaration at hire. In the absence of a completed withholding declaration, withholding tax will be applied as if the employee had claimed \"Single\" status with no withholding allowances on their W-4 and DE-4.\n(2) Tax Treaties\nSome employees who are not residents of the U.S. may qualify for full or partial exemption from withholding tax based on tax treaties between the U.S. and their country of tax residence. Texts of most treaties (in both English and the language of the other country) are available from the IRS website. For more information and to obtain the necessary documents to claim a tax treaty, see How to: Claim Tax Treaty for Salary Payments on the Fingate website.\n(3) Social Security Number\nA Social Security number is required for all employees working in the U.S. Employees who do not already have a Social Security number may begin employment, but must immediately apply for one and obtain a receipt of application. Once received, the hiring department must enter the employee's Social Security number in the university's human resource management system.\n4. Payroll Accounting\na. Semi-Monthly Payroll\nUniversity employees are paid semimonthly. Pay periods are the 1st through 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month. See Payroll Schedules and Deadlines on the Fingate website.\nb. Salary Approvals\nDepartment heads or other authorized university officers approve charges of salaries and wages to their projects, tasks and awards (PTAs) in accordance with budgets, compensation policies, and collective bargaining agreements. In addition to the department head, certain offices have responsibility for reviewing salaries and wages for specific categories of employees. Salary changes, supplementary compensation, salary during leave of absence, and termination of salary require the same authorization and review. Supervisors (or, in their absence, designees with first-hand knowledge of employees work hours) are responsible for approving employees' timecards, including leave usage for exempt and non-exempt employees and work hours for non-exempt employees.\nFaculty and Academic Staff: Salaries for faculty and academic staff are reviewed and approved by the cognizant dean and the Provost's Office.\nSalaried Staff: Salaries for staff employees are established, reviewed, and approved by the cognizant dean, director, or equivalent university officer. In some cases, review by Human Resources is also required.\nHourly-paid Staff: Hourly wages are reviewed and approved by Human Resources.\nStudents: See Undergraduate Student Wage Scales, Guide Memo 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships, and the Graduate Student Assistantship Supplement.\nc. Charges to Projects, Tasks and Awards\nFinancial Management Services (FMS) charges salary and wage expenditures to PTAs designated by the department through Labor Schedules. Oracle Business Intelligence (OBI) reporting provides information about charging salary through a number of monthly expenditure reports. The Consolidated Expenditure Reporting dashboard focuses on the PTAs where salary has already been charged. The Payroll and Labor Management dashboard focuses more on the individual employee. See the Fingate website for the training information and requirements that must be completed to access Labor Schedules.\n(1) Multiple Activities/Accounts\nIf an employee is paid from more than one PTA, the authorized portion of salary or wage is allocated to the appropriate PTA. The paycheck or bank deposit advice delivered to the employee combines all earnings into one check.\n(2) Organization Suspense Account\nEach department designates an unrestricted PTA as an Organization Suspense Account to which salaries of department employees are charged whenever the source of salary funding (such as a grant or contract) runs out and is not immediately replaced by alternative funding. Charges to Organization Suspense Account PTAs, which are charged to the expenditure type 51610, should be reviewed on a timely basis to determine if transfers are needed. See Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers.\n5. Taxes on Salaries and Wages\na. Taxable Earnings\nThe university withholds Federal, State, and other applicable taxes from all taxable earnings paid to employees. Taxable earnings include regular pay, overtime pay, supplementary compensation, and any additional and miscellaneous payments for work performed for the university. This may also include taxable reimbursements. See Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses for additional details on taxable reimbursements.\nb. W-2 Statements\nAt the end of each tax year (January 1 through December 31), Stanford compiles and distributes a W-2 statement for each employee. By default, W-2 statements are mailed to the employee's mailing address on file with the university. Employees may elect to have their W-2 statement sent to them electronically in the Axess portal. The university also sends Form W-2 data, as required, to Federal and State governments.\nc. Tax Exemptions\nEmployees may not claim more withholding allowances than those allowed by the Internal Revenue Service or Franchise Tax Board. Fewer allowances may be claimed or additional dollar amount of taxes may be withheld if an employee wishes to increase the amount of tax withheld. Information about completing the IRS W-4 form and Franchise Tax Board form DE-4, used to specify withholding allowances, is located on the Fingate website at How to: Declare or Change Withholding Allowances. \nd. Student Employees\nStudents who take jobs with the university while pursuing their studies are paid through the university payroll. Degree-seeking Stanford student employees, who are employed while enrolled in classes, do not pay Social Security taxes or Disability Insurance.\ne. Scholarships and Fellowships\nScholarship and fellowship payments are not considered payments for work performed and the recipients are not placed in an employer-employee relationship because of receipt of this money from the university.\nf. Research and Teaching Assistants\nResearch and teaching assistantships are taxable and tax is withheld from the semi-monthly salary.\ng. Non-California Residents\nEmployees who physically work in California are treated as California residents for California tax purposes.\nh. Tax Status of Non-U.S. Residents\nSalaries and wages paid to non-residents of the U.S. fall under the tax laws of the United States and the state of California. The specific provisions of the tax laws, treaties, conventions, and determinations in regard to non-residents are handled by the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board.\n6. Payroll Deductions\na. Deductions for Benefits\nEmployees eligible for benefits (e.g., regular staff, faculty) may pay the employee's share of the cost of some insurance programs and benefits by payroll deduction. For more information, go to the Cardinal at Work website.\nb. Other Authorized Deduction\nThe university has authorized voluntary payroll deductions for payments to certain organizations (such as the Stanford Faculty Club). Any employee who wishes to use this procedure should make arrangements directly with the organization for which the deduction is authorized. That organization will send the authorization to Payroll.\nc. Reporting Deductions\nDeductions from each paycheck are itemized on the pay statement. The amounts deducted are sent to the designated organizations.\nd. Cessation of Deductions\n(1) Benefits\nPayroll deductions for benefits cease during leaves of absence without pay. An employee on leave without pay will receive information from the university's leave administrator on how to pay for the employee's share of the costs for applicable insurance plans. Benefit deductions also stop when an employee's status changes to a non-benefits-eligible position (see Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions) and when employment terminates. At that time, terminated employees with retirement savings plans should review the available distribution options on the Cardinal at Work website.\n(2) Other Authorized Deductions\nSuch deductions cease during leaves of absence without pay, at termination of employment, or on retirement.\n7. Delivery of Checks and Bank Deposit Advices\na. Direct Deposit of Paychecks\nEmployees are encouraged to have their paychecks deposited directly into their bank accounts. Employees may use any bank, savings and loan or credit union that is a member of the Automated Clearing House and can accept electronic fund transfers. Direct deposit enrollment instructions are available at How to: Enroll/Update/Cancel Direct Deposit on the Fingate website.\nb. Delivery of Semi-monthly Paychecks\nPay statements are provided for all employees electronically in the Axess portal. Payroll distributes live paychecks to the mailing address on file. Paper pay statements are distributed through interdepartmental mail. Employees who wish to receive a paper pay statement must select this option in the Axess portal.\nc. Undelivered Checks\nPayroll will reach out to the department and/or the employee for checks returned by the Post Office in an effort to re-mail the checks to the employee. Paychecks issued in error must be returned to Payroll for cancellation and reversal of earnings from the employee's W-2.\nd. Stale-Dated Checks\nPaychecks are negotiable for six months from date of issue. Stale-dated checks should be returned to Payroll for reissue. Funds from checks not cashed after one year from date of issue are remitted to the Unclaimed Property Bureau.\ne. Delivery of Final Paycheck\nAn individual's final paycheck must include the total amount of salary or wages owed as of the date of termination. This includes all payments due, including accumulated, unused vacation leave, PTO and floating holiday, less authorized deductions. The department should contact Employee & Labor Relations in advance if questions arise.\nIf the university initiates the termination, or if the employee initiates the termination and gives at least 72 hours notice, the final paycheck must be given to the employee on the date of termination.\nWhen an employee initiates the termination and gives less than 72 hours notice, the final paycheck is due to the employee within 72 hours after termination. Departments are responsible for making sure final paychecks are delivered to employees under the time limitations provided by law. A completed termination transaction must be submitted to Payroll in order to process the final paycheck. \n8. Salary and Wage Calculations\na. Vacation Payment and Vacation Credit\nVacation earned but unused at termination is paid on the basis of the employee\u2019s hourly rate at termination. For salaried employees at 100% FTE, the hourly rate is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year). If an employee leaves one position and accepts another position within the university, the employee retains their accumulated vacation accruals. (See Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations). The vacation accrual template found at How to: Calculate Vacation Accrual on the Fingate website and can be used to calculate vacation when an employee terminates.\nb. Partial Pay Period Pay Calculation\nPay for less than a full pay period for new or terminating salaried employees is calculated by dividing the annual salary by 2080 (hours in a working year) and multiplying that number by the number of days the employee actually worked, including adjacent holidays, in the pay period multiplied by eight (assume eight hours/day for a full-time exempt employee.) Holidays are counted as workdays when the employee works or is on paid leave (including vacation), both the day immediately preceding and the day following a holiday.\n9. Special Situations\na. Salary Advances\nUnder certain circumstances as described below, salary advances are available to regular staff employees who are not in bargaining units. (Find information on salary advances for Bargaining Unit members in the applicable agreement.)\n(1) Vacation Advance\nAn employee scheduled to take vacation leave of at least 10 consecutive workdays outside the San Francisco Bay Area, may request early payment of any regular paychecks that would be issued during that period.\n(2) Emergency Advance\nOnly in an emergency and with the concurrence of their department, a regular employee may receive an advance of salary already earned in one pay period prior to the regular payday for that pay period. No more than two emergency advances for the same employee will be processed in a 12-month period.\nb. Faculty Terminations\nA faculty member leaving after completing the employment obligation but before the designated end date of their appointment may receive the balance of salary through a special processing procedure. If this option is exercised, the faculty member's status as an employee ends on the termination date. The termination date must not be later than the date of the final check."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/lodging", "text": "Lodging\nIndividuals traveling on university business are expected to use lodging accommodations that are necessary and cost effective. The cost of hotel and lodging should be kept to a minimum and consistent with a reasonable level of comfort, convenience, and security for the traveler.\nTravel Period\nA travel period may begin one day ahead of a business event (for example, arriving on Sunday for a conference that begins on Monday). The business travel period may include weekends, holidays and other necessary standby days if they fall between business travel days. If a traveler chooses to arrive early or to stay longer for non-business reasons, the university does not pay for expenses incurred during those additional days. Exceptions include when travel is at a lower total cost if the traveler stays over a weekend or holiday, with department approval, or when traveling more than eight time zones, The traveler must document the reason for this extra expense in order to support the non-business-day payment.\nTravel 30 Days or Longer\nLong term travel is defined as when a travel period is 30 days or longer. In these instances, the traveler is required to use the per diem reimbursement method, and the per diem rate is reduced to 55 percent for the trip. The assumption is that when staying 30 days or longer, a traveler can find cheaper accommodations than regular hotel rates.\nThe reduced rate will not be calculated by the Expense Requests System so the expense report preparer should calculate the reduced rates (0.55 x listed rate) and enter the adjusted amount in the Expense Requests System via the Adjusted Per Diem expense type in transaction lines.\nLong term lodging expenses are paid only if the traveler incurs two sets of living expenses simultaneously and there is a stated Stanford business purpose for the expenses incurred during the long term travel. If the traveler rents or subleases their primary residence during the long term travel, the traveler may not be paid for lodging expenses at a location away from Stanford.\nTo learn about travel meal policies for travel periods of 30 days or longer, please visit the Travel Meals Policy page.\nTravel Companions\nIn general, the expenses of a spouse, family member or other person accompanying the business traveler are not reimbursable. Such expenses are only allowed if the accompanying person has a position with the university and is traveling to make a significant contribution in furtherance of university business. Exceptions to this policy are rare and must be approved in advance of travel by the Provost.\nSabbatical Expenses\nSabbatical lodging expenses are paid only if the faculty member incurs two sets of living expenses simultaneously and there is a stated Stanford business purpose for the expenses incurred during the sabbatical. If the faculty member rents their primary home during the sabbatical, the faculty member may not be paid for lodging expenses at a location away from Stanford.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nIt is the responsibility of the individual incurring the hotel or lodging expense and those involved in the preparation and approval of the reimbursement request or financial transaction to exercise good stewardship of university funds and to adhere to university policies. The individual incurring the expense and the appropriate administrator must ensure that all costs are in compliance with university travel and business expense policies prior to purchasing. These roles and responsibilities are outlined in Reimbursements & Expense Requests.\nBooking Lodging\nIt is highly encouraged that Stanford travelers use Stanford Travel booking channels when booking flights, hotels, and rental cars for university-sponsored travel. Stanford Travel booking channels automatically register itineraries and any booking updates to the Travel Registry, streamline the reimbursement process, and offer discounts, benefits, and perks to travelers. In addition, the Stanford Travel team can provide specialized assistance as needed to travelers who book through Stanford Travel.\nWhile Stanford Travel booking channels are a great option for most domestic and international travel, there are certain types of travel that need to be booked directly with the airline or hotel. These may include regional air travel offered by local carriers, travel for field research, ticket exchanges or reissues, or certain group reservations. See the chart below and the Airfare policy page for more detail on booking and managing those travel arrangements. For information on the booking processes for various types of travelers, see Topic Overview: Travel Process.\nHotel and Lodging Booking a hotel through Stanford Travel remains the preferred booking option wherever possible, though it is not required. All bookings must follow lodging policy guidance.\t\nGroups of 10 or more Travelers For guidance on booking travel for groups of 10 or more traveling to the same location, submit a Group or Program Travel Request form.\t\nWhen booking lodging, choose a standard room. Upgraded rooms, such as those with upgraded views, additional concierge service or suites, are not reimbursable unless there is no other suitable option. The business purpose should clearly explain why any non-standard room was selected.\nBooking rooms with flexible cancellation policies (refundable rates) is permissible, even if the cost is higher than a non-refundable rate. Travelers are not required to book nonrefundable hotel rates. Booking a non-refundable hotel rate may result in loss of department or personal funds in case cancellation is necessary. Rates should still be within the maximum lodging rates listed on this page.\nFor more information about business and travel policies see the Topic Overview: Business and Travel Expense Policies."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/airfare", "text": "Airfare\nNonrefundable fares are generally preferred, but there may be instances where a refundable fare is appropriate due to comparable pricing or when it is the only option for a traveler. If a refundable fare is chosen, an explanation should be included with the reimbursement request.\nEconomy Class Fares\nThe university pays for air travel in economy class for all domestic and international flights. The university will reimburse for the lowest airfare in economy class that allows for changes to the flight and includes any of the following flight components:\nEarly boarding (such as the Southwest Airlines EarlyBird Check-In)\nPre-assigned seats and preferred seat location\nExtended legroom (such as United Airlines Economy Plus seats or equivalent seats on other airlines)\nChecked and carry-on baggage fees\nIn-flight meal and in-flight Wi-Fi service. \nThese components may be included in the airfare or charged separately as an ancillary fee. Expenditures for these fees must be reasonable and prudent and must be properly documented. Global Entry and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) PreCheck fees are not reimbursable.\nIf this class of fare is not available for the travel period and the most direct route, the next higher level of fare may be selected, but a fare comparison must be provided to demonstrate it was not available.\nNot Recommended: Basic Economy, the lowest airfare in economy class, typically does not include any of the components listed above. It is a highly restrictive airfare which may not allow any changes under any circumstance, and may lead to financial loss. For these reasons, the university does not recommend purchasing this class of fare. As a result, these fares are not displayed in the Stanford Travel booking channels. \nHigher Fare Classes, Such as Business Class Fare\nBusiness class is permissible for international flights with a duration of eight hours or more (including connecting domestic legs, excluding layover time). Departments, at their discretion, can impose more restrictive guidelines for budgetary or control reasons.\nWhen any class above economy airfare (premium economy, business class, first class, etc.) is selected there are two options to appropriately allocate the expense:\nOption 1: Document a fare comparison for the cost of an economy flight in order to ensure that any amount over the economy fare is allocated to an unallowable expenditure type, and when necessary, to an unrestricted award as well. \nOption 2: Allocate one-third of the cost to an allowable expenditure type and the remaining two-thirds to an unallowable expenditure type, which may also require an unrestricted award.\nSee Purpose and Use of Expenditure Type Codes for more information regarding allowable and unallowable expenses. \nThe above process also supports compliance when a sponsored or restricted award is used as the funding source of the airfare. Either option ensures that only the cost of an economy fare is charged to an allowable expenditure type, supporting Stanford\u2019s ability to readily identify and exclude the excess expenses from its indirect cost calculation. For more information on allowability, refer to Administrative Guide 3.1.4: Cost Policy.\nMedical Waivers\nOther classes of travel may be allowed based on documented medical needs by submitting a medical waiver request through the form in Stanford's Services & Support portal. The medical waiver request must be:\nApproved before booking travel in an upgraded class of fare.\nUpdated each fiscal year, unless it explicitly states it is for a long-term condition, in which case it will be valid for five years.\nAny costs associated with health care assistants who are needed during travel should be charged to an unallowable expenditure type.\nChanges and Cancellations\nIf a ticket has to be changed and a penalty is incurred, the traveler may request payment from the university for the penalty. Fees associated with changes to the itinerary, provided there is a business reason (i.e. previously confirmed meeting dates or time have changed), are allowable on sponsored and non-sponsored projects and are reimbursable to the traveler. Itinerary changes due to meetings ending early are considered a personal expense and are not reimbursable. \nWhen trips must be cancelled, travelers are encouraged to rebook tickets for travel at a later date whenever possible. If it is not possible to use the ticket within the rebooking timeframe, it may nevertheless be reimbursable with proper documentation. An unused ticket affidavit must be completed and submitted in the Expense Requests System with an expense report. Unused tickets must be charged to an unrestricted account (PTA) and need to use the appropriate unallowable expenditure type. In some circumstances, travelers may request payment for tickets to be used later by requesting an advance in the Expense Requests System."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/proper-use-funds", "text": "Proper Use of Funds\nEveryone in the Stanford community, including staff, faculty and students, is responsible for making sure that university funds are spent appropriately and that they act in accordance with Administrative Guide Policy 1.1.1: University Code of Conduct, including holding one another to a high standard of integrity and quality. Just the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can be damaging to the university\u2019s reputation, impacting its relationships with donors or sponsors.\nA number of considerations guide approving, reviewing and correcting transactions to ensure that resources are used appropriately, support the university mission, and comply with university policies, applicable laws and regulations, and sponsor or donor restrictions. Transaction requesters, preparers and approvers should all keep these considerations in mind as they complete their tasks."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/policy/administrative-guide-policy-1011-undergraduate-student-employment", "text": "10.1.1 Undergraduate Student Employment | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 24\nThis Guide Memo outlines policies and procedures for employment of Stanford undergraduate students by the university. For employment of graduate students in research and teaching assistantships, see Guide Memo 10.2.1. For employment of graduate students in hourly positions, see Guide Memo 10.2.2. \n1. Definitions and Distinctions\na. Student Hourly Employment\nStanford University uses student hourly employment to hire Stanford students for jobs that are specifically earmarked for matriculated students. All Stanford University student employment is hourly, with the exception of assistantships, which are limited to graduate students (see Guide Memo 10.2.1). Student workers are supervised and mentored in their work, are hired through the university HR system, and must record and approve their work hours each pay period. Routine employment procedures, such as recording time and leave, are also a means for preparing student workers for their future employment. Compensation for all undergraduate student jobs must be established on an hourly basis, and the amount of pay is based on the actual number of hours worked in each pay period. These job assignments are incidental to the student\u2019s course of study with reasonable limitations placed during the academic quarter on the nature of the work assignment and the number of hours of employment. Students cannot volunteer for positions that are normally paid positions.\nb. Stipend\nConsistent with Stanford\u2019s mission to promote the advancement of public welfare through educational cultivation with a hands-on approach, the University supports students engaging in paid and unpaid opportunities that further their own intellectual journey and academic training. In some cases, an unpaid opportunity may be supported by a stipend to defray living expenses. When unpaid work is of an academic nature, the student may receive academic credit with the agreement of the mentoring faculty member.\nA stipend is a payment to an enrolled or continuing student meant to support personal scholarly activities such as an undergraduate research project or experiential learning opportunities such as an unpaid internship. The payment should be intended to help the student defray research costs, living or travel expenses to enable participation in the scholarly activities or experiential learning opportunities. Stipends are not used to pay for services rendered which primarily benefit the faculty member, Stanford University or its programs or as compensation for employment.\nAll undergraduate stipend payments are processed by the Financial Aid Office. Stipends may impact need-based aid and athletic scholarships.\nc. Student Residence Roles\nEach residence on campus has a group of student leaders who facilitate various programmatic components of life in the residences. A stipend to defray living expenses is offered in conjunction with many of these roles (https://resed.stanford.edu/get-involved). Stipends may impact need-based aid and athletic scholarships.\nd. Contingent (Casual or Temporary) Employment\nContingent employment is used to hire an individual for a part-time or temporary staff position. Contingent employment must be used for hourly employment assignments for non-matriculated students or matriculated students when on a Leave of Absence. Contingent employment is not normally used for enrolled, matriculated Stanford students but must be used for any student working more than 36 hours per week.\ne. Federal Work-Study (FWS)\nStanford University participates in the FWS program as defined in Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Under this program funds are allocated to Stanford to allow students with qualifying financial need to gain valuable work experience while earning money to help pay for college. The program is administered by the Financial Aid Office in coordination with the hiring departments. Under the FWS program, federal funds are used to pay 75% of student wages, and the Provost pays the remaining 25%. A subset of the FWS program, Community Service Work-Study, allows qualifying students to work off campus at nonprofits (more information).\nf. Off-Campus Internships and Off-Campus Employment\nOff-Campus internships and employment are not covered by this policy, with the exception of federal Community Service Work-Study positions managed by the Haas Center for Public Service. In both cases, students are encouraged to be mindful that their primary obligation is to their academic program. International students must also adhere to visa requirements.\n2. Listing Student Jobs\na. Job Listing Services\nStanford departments wishing to hire undergraduate students as part-time workers are strongly encouraged to use the Handshake system administered by Stanford Career Education to list their job openings. Programs should log onto https://stanford.joinhandshake.com/login to post a job and reach a large cross section of students. All job postings must include the pay range for the position.\nb. Hours Per Week\nStudents are encouraged to limit their hours of work so that they may devote sufficient attention to their studies. Therefore, the jobs listed for undergraduates during any enrollment period should not typically require more than 15 hours per week of work. During break periods between quarters, undergraduates may be employed full time. \nThanksgiving Break:\nRestrictions on student work hours do not apply during Thanksgiving recess, beginning the day after classes end (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing through the day before classes resume.\nBetween Quarter Breaks:\nRestrictions on student work hours do not apply beginning the day after the University final exam period ends (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing through the day before classes begin the following quarter.\nFor example: students\u2019 employment hours are not limited between the Saturday after Autumn quarter final exams, through the Sunday before Winter classes begin.\nIndividual university holidays, e.g., President\u2019s Day and Memorial Day, do not constitute a break.\nc. International students\nInternational students on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both University policies on employment and visa requirements that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply. Students should consult with Bechtel International Center (https://bechtel.stanford.edu/) if they have questions about work eligibility and limitations on work hours.\nd. Students on Financial Aid\nNearly half of Stanford\u2019s undergraduate population receives need-based aid and most are expected to contribute toward their costs through employment. The standard expectation can be met by working eight to ten hours per week. Not all students receiving aid will qualify for Federal Work-Study; when possible, department funded jobs should be made available for students on aid.\ne. Non-Discrimination\nNon-discrimination policies applicable to regular staff, as stated in Guide Memo 2.1.2, section 2.a, and also apply to student employees.\n3. Schedule of Job Categories\nThe following schedule is designed to promote consistency in student pay. Starting wages in these categories are based on the requirements of the job and the applicable experience of the student. Range within levels is available to allow employers' flexibility in setting student wage rates as job requirements and student performance vary widely. The wage scale is updated annually at http://financialaid.stanford.edu/aid/employ/wage_scale. All job postings must include the pay range for the position.\na. Level I\nThe work at this level requires that employees perform tasks characterized by a prescribed standard. Duties typically are repetitive and workers follow simple instructions that require little interpretation or skill. The supervisor determines work priorities and reviews work for accuracy. Typical kinds of work at this level include:\nOffice work requiring minimum skills, such as file clerk, messenger, or receptionist\nLight manual labor such as animal caretaker, driver, or tour guide\nRudimentary laboratory work such as glassware washer\nLibrary work such as shelving, checking in materials, completing forms, photocopying, or preparing materials for binding\nb. Level II\nAt this level, employees have independent responsibility for the accurate completion of a variety of tasks requiring judgment and interpretation in applying procedures correctly. The supervisor generally reviews the work for correct final results. Typical kinds of work at this level include:\nOffice work requiring basic accounting, or knowledge of office machines\nStrenuous labor such as gardener or storekeeper\nTechnical work requiring specialized skills such as photographer, or projectionist\nLaboratory work requiring a moderate level of scientific knowledge\nLibrary work such as answering information questions, basic use of claims and invoices, or nonroutine clerical duties\nc. Level III\nAt this level, employees have substantial responsibility for determining work procedures and methods of work and for coordinating phases of work with others. Originality, analysis, and judgment are required to carry out work. The supervisor reviews work when guidance is required. Typical kinds of work include:\nComputer programmer\nAdministrative assistant\nMusician, or artist\nJob recruiter\nLibrary work that requires extensive use of foreign languages, having responsibility for a branch library or similar unit for long periods of time without supervision, or very specialized bibliographic searching including in-depth use of RLIN\n4. Hiring, Paying, and Supervising Students\na. Hiring\nThe supervisor notifies the human resources administrator to make the appropriate system entry. Students should be hired into the appropriate Job Classification Code (JCC). The student must be hired into the university HR system before beginning work. Students who are hired during summer quarter, but who are not enrolled, must be hired as Student Hourly Employees using the appropriate Summer Student JCC. This step is required even if the student is continuing a work assignment that started during the academic year. Procedures for hiring FWS students can be found at http://financialaid.stanford.edu/faculty_staff/undergraduate.\nStudents who receive a university award that includes funding to hire undergraduate students to complete hourly work (e.g., coding, transcription, or other effort associated with academic projects) are subject to these policies. In such cases, the department should manage the funding and hire the student hourly employee.\nb. Remote Work\nSome departments may have work conducive to hiring student hourly employees who perform some, or all, of their work at a remote site. When considering whether a remote work arrangement is appropriate, managers should take into consideration, among other factors, the nature of the work, the costs, and whether the work should or must be performed remotely.\nDecisions about the suitability of remote work arrangements are discretionary and require approval from the Dean or Associate Dean, Vice or Associate Vice Provost or Vice or Associate Vice President or designee as well as the local senior HR Manager. Remote work performed outside of California is subject to Guide Memo 2.2.2 Out-of-State Employees.\nc. Payment\nDepartments pay student workers from their own sources of funding, except for students who qualify for FWS. Hourly student workers must record actual hours worked in Axess Timecard each pay period. Each month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls on or immediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.\nd. Supervision\nOne person should be named as the student's immediate supervisor and should be directly accountable for overseeing the student's work and ensuring view and approval of hours worked in Axess.\ne. Work Schedules\nA student is expected to work the agreed hours, be punctual and satisfy all reasonable requirements of the employer with regard to performance and behavior. Most on-campus employers build in some flexibility in hours given students' exam schedules, but that is not always possible and students are expected to carry through if they have agreed to be at work.\nf. Sick Time\nSick time provides a mechanism to pay student hourly employees when they are unable to perform their work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons. All Stanford student hourly employees receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee\u2019s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours. For information about the accrual and use of sick time for student hourly employees, see Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1."}

Many of the policies found there apply to all populations served by GFS.\nFor staff supporting matriculated or non-matriculated graduate students in academic units, your School\u2019s Dean\u2019s Office is often your best source of information and support for funding policy and associated questions. Review the Contacts page to find the appropriate contacts. For staff outside of these schools, contact the student services officer in the graduate student\u2019s home department for information about local policies and practices. \nThe following sections detail by population the specific policy resources in those publications plus additional resources.\nGraduate Students\nFor degree-seeking graduate students, in particular, the GAP contains university policies and other information related to academic progress from application and admission to the conferral of degrees and retention of records. Chapter 7, Graduate Student Funding, provides an overview of graduate financial policy and explanations of many types of graduate Fellowships and Assistantships, including academic eligibility and enrollment requirements for each, and the roles of offices across campus. \nUniversity policies related to Student Employment, including hourly employment and Assistantships are found in the Administrative Guide, Chapter 10.\nThe Financial Aid Office presents information for students including the availability of Student Loans and the standard Student Budget. Information about Stanford Support Programs for graduate students is also provided, including the Emergency Grant in Aid Program, Graduate Student Aid Fund, Graduate Family Grant, and Graduate Housing Loans for students living off campus. You will also find a detailed FAQ about the Cardinal Care Subsidy program. The Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education (VPGE) also provides competitive funding to support individual doctoral student, student groups, and department-based projects. \nInformation about managing funding that graduate students bring to Stanford from outside sources, including Nationally Competitive Fellowships, can be found in Chapter 7.2 of the GAP, as well as from the Financial Aid Office.\nDetailed information about Coterminal Student eligibility can be found in the Chapter 4.2 of the GAP. \nThe Financial Aid Office also maintains a detailed FAQ about the Cardinal Care Subsidy program that is suitable for sharing with students.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-314-cost-policy", "text": "3.1.4 Cost Policy | Administrative Guide\nSkip to main content Skip to secondary navigation \nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nJuly 26, 2022 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.5\nThis Guide Memo outlines general policies on expense reimbursement by the federal government and discusses the importance of assigning the correct Project, Task and Award (PTA) and Expenditure Type to expenses and credits. For more detailed information, see Purpose and Use of Expenditure Type Codes on the Gateway to Financial Activities website. \n1. Background\nAbout a quarter of all funding for University expenditures comes from the federal government. Most of this funding comes in the form of direct support for sponsored projects, but a substantial portion comes in the form of reimbursement for indirect costs of federally sponsored grants and contracts. Stanford tracks whether University activities are allowable for reimbursement using the Project, Task and Award (PTA) to which transactions are charged, and tracks allowable and unallowable cost objects through the Expenditure Type used to record transactions.\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted financial approval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects.

Definitions\nDirect Costs are expenses that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project or other direct cost objective, such as Auxiliary Activities or Instruction, or expenses that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.\nExample: cost of materials used on a project\nIndirect Costs are those incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily with a particular sponsored project. Indirect costs are sometimes called Facility & Administrative (F&A) or overhead costs.\nExample: costs of buildings or utilities\n3. General Rules\nRules for allowability are covered in the government document OMB Circular A-21 and the Uniform Guidance. In many cases, the issue of whether a particular cost is allowable is a complex one. When in doubt, consult with your local financial or research administrator, the Office of Sponsored Research or Research Financial Compliance and Services (RFCS). All unallowable activities and objects (line items) must be coded as such. In general, expenses are chargeable to the federal government only if they are:\nReasonable: A prudent person would have purchased this item and paid this price.\nAllocable: Expenses can be allocated to the government activity based on benefit derived, cause and effect, or other equitable relationship.\nConsistently Treated: Like expenses must be treated the same in like circumstances.\nAllowable: Allowable for reimbursement as specified by government regulations.\nIf an expense cannot meet the above criteria, it is not eligible to be charged to a federal grant or contract no matter what its purpose.\nNote: Agencies that sponsor grants and contracts use the term allowable to mean permitted as a direct cost under the terms of a specific grant or contract. Expenses that are generally allowable for federal reimbursement may not necessarily be permitted under the terms of a specific grant or contract.\n4. Unallowable Costs\nExpenses that are unallowable for federal reimbursement as a direct or indirect cost may still be reasonable and necessary business expenses permitted by the University, as outlined in the Administrative Guide. Departments may incur these expenses, but they must be coded as unallowable so they can be readily identified and excluded from the indirect cost calculation. A detailed list of specifically unallowable activities (Tasks) and objects (Expenditure Types) is provided in theUnderstanding Cost Policy course."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/policy/administrative-guide-policy-1022-graduate-student-hourly-employment", "text": "10.2.2 Graduate Student Hourly Employment\nThis Guide Memo outlines policies and procedures for employment of matriculated Stanford graduate students in positions other than assistantships. For employment of graduate students in research and teaching assistantships, see Guide Memo 10.2.1. For employment of matriculated undergraduate students, see Guide Memo 10.1.1.\nApplicability:\nApplies to the employment of matriculated graduate students in positions other than assistantships. This policy does not apply to non-matriculated graduate students (e.g., Visiting Student Researchers).\n1. Definitions and Distinctions\nStudent hourly employment. Stanford University uses student hourly employment to hire Stanford students into jobs that are specifically earmarked for matriculated students. Student workers are supervised in their work, are hired through the PeopleSoft HR system, and must record and approve their work hours. Compensation is established on an hourly basis, and the amount of pay is based on the actual number of hours worked in each pay period. These job assignments are incidental to the student\u2019s course of study with reasonable limitations placed during the academic quarter on the nature of the work assignment and the number of hours of employment. All Stanford University student employment is hourly, with the exception of assistantships, which are limited to graduate students (see Admin Guide 10.2.1). Hourly employment should never be used to pay a graduate student for work that is appropriately treated as an assistantship.\nGraduate student. This policy applies to students who are enrolled in a graduate degree program (any degree except the BA, BS, or BAS). For purposes of student employment, students enrolled in both undergraduate and graduate degree programs as coterminal students are considered undergraduate students while assessed undergraduate tuition and graduate students while assessed graduate tuition.\nThe Graduate Financial Support (GFS) system is the online application used to enter all research and teaching assistantship appointments, fellowships, and other stipend payments for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. It is not used to process hourly employment.\nJob Classification Codes (JCC) are used to categorize all jobs at Stanford. Students should be hired into the appropriate student JCC for the job for which they are employed. Use of the appropriate JCC ensures that the correct expenditure type and fringe benefit rate are applied as wages are paid.\nDistinctions from Hourly Employment:\nGraduate Student Assistantships are a form of student employment, earning a compensation package including both salary and tuition allowance (TAL) for the performance of research or teaching services to the University as part of the student's academic and professional training and development, see Guide Memo 10.2.1. Hourly employment is not a substitute for an assistantship appointment.\nHonorarium is a stipend payment to recognize a student for an accomplishment or a one-time event or project, such as a recruitment weekend. Honoraria are not used as compensation for employment. Graduate student honorarium payments are processed as stipends in the GFS system.\nStudent Residence Roles are held by a core group of students that are responsible for managing the various programmatic components of life in their on campus residence. A nominal stipend to defray living expenses is offered in conjunction with many of these roles. These payments are processed as stipends in the GFS system. International students should consult with Bechtel International Center about the impact of this effort on restrictions related to on-campus employment.\nOff-Campus Internships and Off-Campus Employment are not covered by this policy. In both cases, students are encouraged to be mindful that their primary obligation is to their academic program. International students must also adhere to visa requirements and should consult with Bechtel International Center before engaging in any off-campus employment or unpaid opportunity.\nContingent (Casual or Temporary) Employment is used to hire an individual for a part-time or temporary staff position. Contingent employment must be used for hourly employment assignments for non-matriculated students, such as Visiting Student Researchers, and for matriculated students when on a Leave of Absence. Contingent employment is not normally used for enrolled, matriculated Stanford students, but must be used for any student working more than 36 hours per week.\n2. Limits on Hours of Employment\nGraduate students are expected to limit their hours of employment, so that they may devote sufficient attention to their studies. Therefore, graduate students are expected to coordinate the number of hours of employment with their academic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and the academic expectations of their program. Additionally, they are expected to coordinate hourly employment with the other forms of financial support that they are receiving. Academic departments/programs, offices employing students, and funding sources may also impose employment limitations.\nLimits on hourly employment and related enrollment limitations for graduate students are summarized in Table 1.\na. Limit on Hours\nThere are formal limits on the number of hours a student may be employed when also financially supported by assistantships or fellowships.\nDuring Autumn, Winter and Spring quarters, enrolled graduate students are limited to 28 hours of student employment, combining hourly employment and assistantship appointments. (International students are subject to additional limitations, see below.) For example, graduate students appointed to 50% (20 hours/week) assistantships may not be employed more than an additional eight hours a week; those additional hours cannot be in other assistantship positions. Graduate students with full fellowship funding are limited to additional employment of 8 hours/week hourly employment or a 25% assistantship, but not both. The source of the fellowship or the student\u2019s academic department/program may impose stricter limits.\nDuring Summer quarter, enrolled graduate students are limited to 36 hours of student employment, combining hourly employment and assistantship appointments. (International students may be subject to additional limitations, see below.) For example, students on 50% time (20 hours/week) assistantships may not be employed more than an additional 16 hours a week; those additional hours can combine either assistantships or hourly employment. In summer, students who are employed more than 8 hours with a 50% assistantship are expected to reduce the number of units of enrollment commensurate with a larger percentage appointment. (This is shown in the TAL table for Summer Quarter.) Graduate students with full fellowship funding are limited to additional employment of 16 hours/week hourly employment or a 50% assistantship, but not both. The source of the fellowship or the student\u2019s academic department/program may impose stricter limits.\nb. Additional Limits on Hours\nDuring break periods when school is officially not in session, the University does not limit the number of hours graduate students may be employed. For on campus employment, University guidelines on overtime pay apply. Note that graduate student research and teaching assistantships are made for a full quarter and hours associated with assistantships include these break periods. Policy related to assistantships is located in Administrative Guide 10.2.1: Graduate Student Assistantships.\nInternational students must contact Bechtel International Center for information about off-campus employment authorization (see Bechtel International Center\u2019s website under \u201cEmployment\u201d).\nThanksgiving Break:\nRestrictions on student work hours do not apply during Thanksgiving recess, beginning the day after classes end (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing through the day before classes resume.\nBetween Quarter Breaks:\nRestrictions on student work hours do not apply beginning the day after the University final exam period ends (as detailed on the official university academic calendar) and continuing through the day before classes begin the following quarter.\nFor example: students\u2019 employment hours are not limited between the Saturday after Autumn quarter final exams, through the Sunday before Winter classes begin.\nSummer Quarter:\nSummer quarter employment rules vary depending upon student enrollment and visa status. Refer to the information and chart below for additional information. \nIndividual university holidays, e.g., President\u2019s Day and Memorial Day, do not constitute a break.\nAlthough university policy does not restrict employment hours during these break periods, individual academic programs may define more restrictive policies. Students must check with their academic program for any restrictions.\nc. Additional Limits on Hours for International Students on F-1 or J-1 Visas\nInternational students on F-1 or J-1 visas are subject to both university policies on employment and visa regulations that limit employment; in all cases, the more restrictive limitation will apply.\nInternational students are eligible for on-campus employment if they are maintaining F-1 or J-1 status (J-1 students must obtain work authorization from Bechtel International Center for both on-campus and off-campus employment). During the academic year (Autumn, Winter and Spring quarters), enrolled students on F-1or J-1 visas are limited to a total of 20 hours of employment per week (except during break periods), including both hourly jobs and assistantship appointment(s), and including any off-campus employment that they may have been authorized to perform.\nDuring Summer quarter, most international students are subject to the general University policies for summer graduate student employment, and their F-1 or J-1 visa does not further restrict their hours of employment. However, any graduate student who is required to enroll full time in summer quarter in order to maintain legal visa status\u2014such as newly admitted students who will start their program in the summer, or those students returning from a leave of absence in the summer\u2014may not work more than a combined total of 20 hours per week.\nDuring University defined break periods as defined in section 2b above, neither the University or federal regulations limit the number of hours international graduate students may be employed, provided they are eligible and intend to register for the next academic quarter.\nFurther information regarding employment limits for students on F-1 or J-1 visas is available from the Bechtel International Center.\nTable 1: Maximum Number of Hours of Hourly Employment Permitted per Week\nFunding source or the student\u2019s academic department/program may impose stricter limits. Footnotes describe the related limitations on enrollment.\nSTUDENT STATUS\nFUNDING STATUS\n50% ASSISTANTSHIP1\nASSISTANTSHIP BETWEEN 10-40%\nFULL FELLOWSHIP\nNO OTHER GRADUATE FUNDING\nACADEMIC YEAR (ENROLLED STUDENTS)\nU.S. Citizen or Legal Permanent Resident\t8 hours\t28 hours minus hours of assistantship\t8 hours or 25% assistantship, but not both\t28 hours\t\nF-1 or J-1 student Visa holders\t0 hours\t20 hours minus hours of assistantship\t8 hours or 25% assistantship, but not both\t20 hours\t\nSUMMER (ENROLLED STUDENTS)\nU.S. Citizen or Legal Permanent Resident; F-1 or J-1 student Visa holders (unless Visa requires full-time enrollment) \t16 hours\t36 hours minus hours of assistantship2\t16 hours or 50% assistantship, but not both\t36 hours.3\t\nF-1or J-1 student Visa holders whose Visa requires full-time enrollment\t0 hours\t20 hours minus hours of assistantship\t16 hours or 50% assistantship, but not both\t20 hours\t\nBREAK AND NON-ENROLLMENT PERIODS\nU.S. student\tNo university limits - See Section 2.b. above\t\nF-1 or J-1 student Visa holders\tNo university limits - See Section 2.b. above\t\nStudents with a 50% assistantship are limited to 10 units, TGR, or graduation quarter enrollment.\nIn summer, students are expected to reduce enrollment below full-time status if they accept an assistantship of more than 50%, or they accept a combination of assistantship and hourly work that total more than 28 hours per week.\nMore than 36 hours requires hiring as a Contingent (Casual or Temporary) employee through Human Resources and non-enrollment. Enrolled students cannot work more than 36 hours.\nSome international students are required to enroll full-time due to Visa requirements and immigration law (see Enrollment Requirements on the Bechtel International Center website). Students should consult with Bechtel International Center regarding their individual enrollment requirements.\nThe percentage of the assistantship appointment determines the amount of Tuition Allowance (TAL) that is provided and the expectations for the number of units of enrollment. This is shown in the TAL table.\n3. Hiring, Paying and Supervising Students\na. Hiring\nThe supervisor notifies the human resources administrator to make the appropriate system entry. The students should be hired into the appropriate Job Classification Code (JCC). The student must be hired into PeopleSoft HR before beginning work. Students who are hired during Summer quarter, but who are not enrolled, must be hired as Student Hourly Employees using the appropriate Summer Student JCC. This step is required even if the student is continuing a work assignment that started during the academic year.\nBefore hiring a graduate student for hourly employment, a graduate student assistantship, or any other type of appointment through Human Resources the hiring department should contact the student\u2019s academic home department/program to review the appointment (see the GFS School contact list). The hourly appointment must be reviewed for appropriateness taking into account:\nThe student\u2019s academic obligations, including course load, number of registered units, and other expectations\nOther forms of financial support that the student is receiving, including fellowships and assistantships. Funding sources may impose limits on hourly employment\nAny limits that the student\u2019s home academic department/program imposes (e.g., program may limit hourly student employment)\nLimitations placed on international students\nStudents who receive a university award that includes funding to hire graduate students to complete hourly work (e.g., coding, transcription, or other effort associated with academic projects) are subject to these policies. In such cases, the department should manage the funding and hire the student hourly employee.\nb. Wage rates\nThere is no suggested wage scale for hourly employment for graduate students. When setting the hourly wage rate for a graduate student, the following may be taken into consideration:\nThe tasks required of the student, including the level of independence, judgment and expertise;\nThe student\u2019s experience in similar work assignments;\nWage rate paid to other graduate students in department for comparable work.\nc. Payment\nDepartments pay student workers from their own sources of funding.\nHourly student workers must record actual hours worked in Axess Timecard each pay period. Each month has two pay periods: The first day of the month through the 15th and the 16th through the last day of the month. Paychecks are issued on the workday that falls on or immediately prior to the seventh calendar day after the end of each pay period.\nd. Supervision\nOne person should be named as the student\u2019s immediate supervisor and should be directly accountable for overseeing the student\u2019s work and approving the hours worked in Axess.\ne. Work Schedules and Requirements\nA student is expected to work the agreed hours, be punctual, and satisfy all reasonable requirements of the employer with regard to performance and behavior. Most on-campus employers build in some flexibility in hours given students\u2019 exam schedules, but that is not always possible and students are expected to carry through if they have agreed to be at work.\nf. Sick Time\nSick time provides a mechanism to pay graduate student hourly employees when they are unable to perform their work responsibilities due to illness or for other related reasons as detailed below. All Stanford student hourly employees receive sick time benefits. Arrangements for any variations in work hours, including time off for illness or related uses of sick time, should be made individually with the student hourly employee\u2019s supervisor. To the extent possible, student hourly employees are encouraged to make arrangements outside of their working hours and supervisors are encouraged to offer flexibility in work hours.\nFor information about the accrual and use of sick time for student hourly employees, see Administrative Guide Memo 10.3.1: Sick Time for Student Hourly Employees.\ng. Job Listing\nStanford departments wishing to hire graduate students may use the system administered by BEAM (Bridging Education, Ambition and Meaningful Work) to list their job openings. Departments should log onto Handshake to post a job. Departments may also use their own means of locating student employees.\nh. Non-Discrimination\nNon-discrimination policies applicable to regular staff, as stated in Guide Memo 2.1.2, section 2.a., also apply to student employees."}

Key considerations and associated processes are found in Business and Travel Expense Policies Fundamentals. The university outlines its core responsibility, guiding principles and IRS regulations with regard to business and travel expenses in Administrative Guide Memo 5.4.2."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/travel-meals", "text": "Travel Meals\nDefinition\nA travel meal is defined as an ordinary and necessary meal that occurs while traveling on university business. The primary purpose for reimbursing a travel meal is to defray the cost of meal expenses when traveling outside of one\u2019s local area, which is defined as more than 50 miles one way from home or Stanford, whichever is greater. Unlike a business meal, no additional justification is needed for a travel meal as long as the meal occurs within the business travel period, because it is covered by the business purpose of that trip. The cost of the travel meal must still be deemed reasonable under university policy, as such, the university has established maximums for travel meal reimbursement. \nTravel Companions\nIn general, the expenses of a spouse, family member or other person accompanying the business traveler are not reimbursable. Such expenses are only allowed if the accompanying person has a position with the university and is traveling to make a significant contribution in furtherance of university business. Exceptions to this policy are rare and must be approved in advance of travel by the Provost.\nTravel Period\nA travel period may begin one day ahead of a business event (for example, arriving on Sunday for a conference that begins on Monday). The business travel period may include weekends, holidays, and other necessary standby days if they fall between business travel days. If a traveler chooses to arrive early or to stay longer for non-business reasons, the university does not pay for expenses incurred during those additional days. Exceptions include when travel is at a lower total cost if the traveler stays over a weekend or holiday, with department approval, or when traveling more than eight time zones, The traveler must document the reason for this extra expense in order to support the non-business-day payment.\nTravel Meals for 30 Days or Longer\nLong term travel is defined as when a travel period is 30 days or longer. In these instances, the traveler is required to use the per diem reimbursement method, and the per diem rate is reduced to 55 percent for the trip. The assumption is that when staying 30 days or longer, a traveler can plan for or prepare less expensive meals.\nThe reduced rate will not be calculated by the Expense Requests System so the expense report preparer should calculate the reduced rates (0.55 x listed rate) and enter the adjusted amount in the Expense Requests System via the Adjusted Per Diem expense type in transaction lines.\nTo learn about lodging policies for travel periods of 30 days or longer, please visit the Lodging Policy page.\nGroup Travel Meals\nA group travel meal is when a group of Stanford employees, affiliates or colleagues who are travelling together or attending the same conference share an ordinary and necessary meal. In this example, the meal must be classified as a travel meal, unless it meets the additional requirements of a business meal with a clearly documented business purpose. \nGroup travel meals should adhere to the per person travel meal limits, which are significantly lower than business meal maximums. The meal would be expensed by one participant and the travel meal cost would be deducted from each of the attendees' expense report. The Deducting Provided Meals section on this page provides reasonable guidance for individual meals.\nIt is best practice to have the individual with the highest level of financial approval pay for the group meal and submit the reimbursement so that the expense request can be reviewed by an approver who was not a meal attendee.\nIn the Expense Requests System, include the names of employees that participated in the group travel meal. The attendee list can be entered by listing them directly in the transaction or by attaching the list as a supporting document. \nRoles and Responsibilities\nIt is the responsibility of the individual incurring the travel meal and those involved in the preparation and approval of the reimbursement request or financial transaction to exercise good stewardship of university funds and to adhere to university policies. The individual incurring the expense and the appropriate administrator must ensure that all costs are in compliance with university travel and business expense policies prior to purchasing. These roles and responsibilities are outlined in Reimbursements & Expense Requests."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-321-responsibility-university-funds", "text": "3.2.1 Responsibility for University Funds\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36\nThis Guide Memo describes responsibilities for the management of funds in University Projects, Tasks and Awards (PTAs).\n1. Responsibility for University Funds\na. University Officers' Responsibility\nDeans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators, and other University officials are responsible for the management of funds in their PTAs. See Guide Memo 1.2.1: University Organization. These individuals have the authority to expend these funds to accomplish their assigned responsibilities, and are responsible for assuring that expenditures charged to their PTAs are:\nReasonable and necessary\nConsistent with established University policies and practices applicable to the work of the University, including instruction, research, and public service\nConsistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions\nFor more information on cost policy, see Guide Memo 3.1.4: Cost Policy.\nb. Delegation of Authority\nAuthority to sign expenditure documents for the purchase of services and materials on a PTA may be delegated and the University official may authorize the person to whom authority is delegated to further delegate signature authority. The University official retains accountability for prudent control of the PTA. The University official may place limits on the dollar level and the types of expenditures for which signature authority is delegated. For more information on authorization procedures, review and error correction procedures, and expenditures of restricted funds, please see the Financial Authority section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n2. Authorization Procedures\na. Authority and Required Training\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted financial approval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information, see Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford\u2019s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nb. Delegation of Signature Authority\n(1) University Officials\nA letter from University officials indicating the organization for which they are responsible and the administrator to whom they have delegated the ability to manage authority must be on file with Financial Management Services.\n(2) Delegation of Signature Authority\nTo delegate authority for both electronic and paper form transactions, the person responsible for the organization or PTA must delegate such authority via the Authority Manager.\nc. Electronic Signature\nUsers of campus financial systems identify themselves to these systems using approved, secure authentication methods. See Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems, for details on these methods. In addition to these system-independent authentication methods, financial systems may have system-specific authentication methods (e.g., a username and password for a particular system). Regardless of the authentication method, authentication using any of the approved methods is the electronic equivalent of an employee's hand-written signature and may be used as an \"electronic signature\" in electronic applications.\nd. Signature Security\nOnly the person to whom authority is delegated may authorize a transaction either manually or electronically. Disciplinary steps will be taken against individuals who are found to have fraudulently signed the name of another person, used the authentication information of another person, or divulged their authentication information to another person. The possible disciplinary actions for violations, which can include termination of employment or student status, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. User responsibilities for handling authentication information are described in Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems.\ne. Limitations on Signature Authority\n(1) Expense Reimbursement\nNo person may approve their own expense reimbursement, or the expense reimbursement of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly. Expense reimbursements, which require two signatures, must have the signatures of the person incurring the expense and the person responsible for the management of the PTA or a properly delegated agent.\n(2) Independent Review\nBusiness expenses incurred by or on behalf of the President, the Provost, a direct report to the President or the Provost, or the senior financial officer of the academic units must be approved by an independent reviewer designated by the CFO. Expenses for ordinary supplies, customarily available for all employees in an office, should be approved by a local business official and need not be routed for independent review.\n(3) Salaries\nNo person may sign any payroll/personnel form that affects their own salary, or payroll/personnel forms that affect the salary of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly.\n(4) Conflict of Interest\nNo person may authorize payment to any individual or business where there is a conflict of interest. See Guide Memo 1.5.2: Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest.\nf. Revoking Signature Authority\nThe University official who delegated authority (or the person who currently holds that position) is responsible to ensure granted authority reflects the unit's current needs. When a person with signature authority transfers to another department or leaves the University, their authority is automatically revoked. Changes for other operational reasons can be made at any time through the Authority Manager. For more information, see Quick Steps: Grant, Change, Revoke or Restore Financial Authority to Others on the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n3. Review and Error Correction\na. Departmental Review\nThe deans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators and other University officials to whom funds are allocated are responsible for reviewing their expense transactions and monthly expenditure/operating statements to assure that:\nAny expenditure is necessary and for University purposes.\nCharges are correct.\nCharges are allowable for the PTA.\nCharges are correctly coded as allowable or unallowable for inclusion in the University's indirect cost rate calculations.\nCharges are allocable to the PTA (i.e., necessary to achieve objectives of the project).\nAny allocation of costs is reasonable and equitable.\nCharges are appropriately documented, and are recorded in a consistent manner within departmental accounts.\nb. Evidence of Review\nReview of transactions is evidenced by a manual or electronic signature in the appropriate field of the form.\nc. Responsibility for Error Correction\nThe department is responsible for correction of errors. Time limits for error correction are outlined in Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.3, Cost Sharing Policy. Occasionally errors are found after the regular time limits for correction. Regardless of when the error is found, the University officer whose PTA used the good or service must pay for it, either from the same or another appropriate PTA.\nd. Central Office Review\nTo supplement (but not replace) the University official's basic review responsibility, Financial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Office of Sponsored Research review University selected expense transactions. If incorrect or improper charges are found, the reviewing office directs the person responsible for the expenditures to correct the error. If necessary, the reviewing office may correct the department's error and will provide the department with a copy of the accounting entry.\n4. Expenditures of Restricted Funds\na. Conformity to External Restrictions \u2014 Sponsored Research\nExpenditures of restricted funds, such as organized research or gift funds, whether from federal or non-federal sources, must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the agreement (e.g., grant or cooperative agreement). Expenditures of funds for federally sponsored projects are subject to the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness standards of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR 200, Uniform Guidance), and the negotiated agreements between the University and the federal government. Please see the DoResearch website for more information: http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing Cost-sharing tasks are subject to the same standards as the sponsored project that they support.\nb. Monthly Review of Charges\nFor sponsored projects and related cost-sharing tasks, the expenditure statements must be reviewed each month, as noted in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTA). The review should include areas such as those covered by the Monthly Review Guidance and Monthly Reconciliation tools. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure statement. The review must be completed within two months of the end of the month of the statement (e.g., October expenditures must be reviewed no later than December 31). Principal Investigators may delegate monthly review of expenditures, but may not delegate the Quarterly Certification of Charges (see paragraph 4.c).\nc. Quarterly Certification of Charges\nThe following certification of direct costs is preprinted on expenditure statements for sponsored projects and cost-sharing tasks each month:\n\"I have reviewed the three months of expenditures for this quarter. To the best of my knowledge, all expenditures are appropriate. Where required, corrections have been or will be made through the accounting system. I understand that to be considered timely all corrections must be made within two months of the last day of month being reviewed.\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR'S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________ \nPROJECT TASK MANAGER\u2019S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________\"\nQuarterly certification is the responsibility of the project Principal Investigator (or Co-PI). A PI may delegate the monthly review of statements for accuracy, but may not delegate certification of the appropriateness of the charges. This certification statement must be signed by the principal investigator and the project task manager. Only the last expenditure statement for the academic quarter must be signed by the principal investigator and Project Task Manager. The quarterly certification must be completed within two months of the end of the academic quarter being certified, as described in the Monthly Review and Quarterly PI Review Certification. This signature means that the principal investigator has reviewed all direct charges to the project and that either the charges on the expenditure statement are reasonably accurate as shown, or that the appropriate individual in the department has initiated accounting entries to correct any differences. Review and correction of differences must be completed within the deadlines outlined on the DoResearch site.\nd. Record Retention\nThe certified expenditure statements must be retained in the department files for future review by government and University auditors in accordance with University record retention requirements for sponsored projects (see Guide Memo 3.1.5: Retention of Financial Records.\n5. Expenditures of Gifts\na. Conformity to Donor Restrictions \u2014 Gifts\nGifts, which typically differ from sponsored projects in that they do not require a detailed scope of work, budget, or period of performance, may on occasion have restrictions on the use of funds (to ensure the use is consistent with the donor\u2019s original, accepted, stipulations). If this is the case, the University must take care to allocate the funds to the academic area, group, department, faculty member or other University activity as stipulated. While the academic area or faculty member may have broad discretion over the specific expenditures of support, the donor may expect a report on the general uses of funds donated or even a report on line-item expenses. Donors do not typically recoup gift funds, but if a gift made for a restricted purpose has not, however, been spent according to the donor\u2019s restrictions, a donor may have grounds to rescind and recoup the gifted funds.\nb. Gifts to Stanford made by Faculty, Staff, Spouse or Family member\nTo ensure compliance with regulations governing charitable contributions and to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, gifts made to Stanford by Stanford faculty, staff, spouse or family member: \nShould be placed in a unique account so that the source and use of the gifted funds can be clearly identified.\nMay not be placed in accounts under the control of the donor (e.g. neither the donor, nor any individual reporting to the donor, may have signature authority over the account).\nMay not be used to fund travel, purchases, or any other expense that could be construed by others to benefit the donor for purposes unrelated to their work for the University.\nMay not be used to fund the salary of the donor.\n6. Sources for More Information\nCognizant Office\nFinancial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Research Financial Compliance and Services (RFCS) office are available to answer questions about expenditure authorization.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-313-expenditure-accounts-ptas", "text": "3.1.3 Expenditure Accounts (PTAs) | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 34.2\nThe University's Oracle Financial system has two core accounting applications: Grants Accounting (GA) and General Ledger (GL). The GA subledger records all detailed expenditure transactions and then summarizes them in the GL. The GA module has five segments: Project (P), Task (T), Award (A), Expenditure types (E) and Organization. A Project (P) is an activity or event with a single purpose. A Task (T) is a further breakdown of the project; every project has at least one task. An Award (A) is a funding source for a particular project or task. Find further information on the University's Chart of Accounts at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. This Guide Memo describes the various kinds of expenditure accounts or PTAs (the intersection of Project, Task, and Award) within the University's accounting system.\n1. Operating Budget PTA\na. Purpose\nOperating Budget PTAs are the primary PTAs for the University's core academic programs and support services. Operating Budget PTAs are used to record accounting transactions for these core activities.\nb. Source of Funds\nAt the beginning of the fiscal year, Operating Budget PTAs receive money only from University unrestricted funds and from appropriate departmental designated funds, gift funds, and endowment income funds (see Guide Memo 3.1.2: University Funds). Changes in funding during the year may be made online by authorized budget officers.\nc. Setting Up\nThe Fund Accounting department of the Controller's Office sets up and maintains PTAs funded from the University's Operating Budget. To request a new Operating Budget P, T, and/or A, a person who has organizational authority submits the Fund Accounting PTA Request form via email to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office. The form is located at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA. \nd. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end (August 31), all unused restricted funds that are held in an Operating Budget Award must be returned to their original source fund. If expenditures have exceeded the Expense Control, other sources of funding must be identified to cover the deficit. If there are still budgeted funds available, work with the University's Budget Office to determine how to handle these funds.\ne. Closing an Operating Budget PTA\nAt any time, a department may send a memo to Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office requesting that an Operating Budget P, T, and/or A be closed to expense. The P, T, and/or A will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n2. Grant and Contract PTA\na. Purpose\nA grant or contract fund and related expenditure PTA(s) are used to record accounting transactions for a sponsored project. The Research Policy Handbook 13.1, sets out criteria for determining if external support for a project should be handled as a sponsored project. Note that external support that does not meet these criteria is handled as a gift.\nb. Source of Funds\nA grant or contract fund receives money from the agency sponsoring the research, instruction, or other sponsored activity at the University. Proposals for grants and contracts are processed through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or its delegates. Additional information is available at the DoResearch website. \nc. Setting Up\nWhen a grant or contract has been awarded, OSR assigns a fund (award) number for the sponsored project, and sets up related Project(s) and Task(s) as requested. OSR handles any subsequent accounting system maintenance during the life of the award. OSR also receives awards for student aid directly from a school or from the Graduate Financial Aids Office. The form used to request a PTA is located here. \nd. Early Accounts\nFor the effective and economical conduct of a sponsored project, it is sometimes necessary for costs to be incurred before the award document has been received. In such cases, departments should request that OSR set up an early PTA. The \"Authorization for Early Project Task and Award Request\" form is available online here.The early PTA becomes the permanent PTA when the award is effective; no cost transfers are needed. Pre-award costs must be charged to a pre-award account and may not be placed on an unrelated award and later transferred to the benefiting PTA.\ne. Ongoing PTA Management\n(1) Allowability of Expenditures\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) is accountable for the accuracy, allowability, allocability, appropriateness and timely review of charges to a grant or contract PTA (or a related cost sharing PTA) and for ensuring that expenditures do not exceed the level authorized by the award. See Guide Memos:\n3.1.4: Cost Policy\n3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures\n3.2.2: Cost Transfers\n3.2.3: Allocations and Offsets\n(2) Approvals\nThe terms of the award and governing cost principles may require approval from the agency for such actions as rebudgeting funds, travel, or purchasing capital equipment. OSR processes approval requests.\n(3) Review\nThe PI or someone else knowledgeable about the sponsored project must review the PTA each month, bringing any questionable items to the PI for decision on any needed action. Review guidance and tools are available at DoResearch. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure report.\n(4) Suballocations\nA suballocation of a grant or contract may be set up to handle accounting for:\nA subcontract\nSeparate portions of the work\nFabrication of capital equipment\nA conference associated with the project: This is usually accomplished by setting up additional Tasks within the Project, linked to the appropriate award(s).\nf. Fiscal Year End\nAccounting records for grant and contract PTAs are closed for reporting purposes at fiscal year end. The entire budget and all expenditures for the period of the award are carried forward to the new fiscal year expenditure reports.\ng. Closing a Grant or Contract PTA\n(1) Definition\nCloseout is the administrative process whereby sponsors determine whether all technical and administrative requirements of the grant or contract have been completed. Sponsored projects are considered completed or \"closed out\" only after the sponsor receives and approves all technical, financial, invention and property reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award and notifies Stanford of its acceptance and signoff.\n(2) Principal Investigator's Responsibilities\nAt the close of a grant or contract, the Principal Investigator is accountable for ensuring that the expenses recorded are complete, allowable, allocable, and without overdrafts. For more information, see Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.8 Cost Transfer Policy for Sponsored Projects.\n(3) Office of Sponsored Research Responsibilities\nOSR prepares the final financial reports and performs a review. Generally, the final financial report is due 90 days after the end of the award.\n3. Cost-Sharing PTA\na. Purpose\nCost sharing represents that portion of the total project costs of a sponsored agreement borne by the University, rather than the sponsor. The Research Policy Handbook 15.3 states the University's policy on cost sharing. Separate PTAs must be established to track committed cost sharing. This is usually accomplished by setting up a cost sharing Task in the Project that holds the sponsored project, and linking it to a cost-sharing award.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe Principal Investigator must identify and provide resources to fund the cost-sharing PTA. Funds from other federal awards may not be used as the source of cost sharing except as authorized by statute. Funds generally come from unrestricted, gift, endowment income, or designated funds.\nc. Setting Up\nThe notice of award prepared by OSR and the signed award document indicate if the project involves cost sharing. OSR will not open the sponsored PTA until the related cost-sharing PTA is opened. When a cost-sharing PTA is required, a person with signature authority over the fund from which the cost-sharing PTA will be funded or guaranteed sends a copy of the cost-sharing budget and the Cost-Sharing Authorization form to OSR requesting the PTA be opened. For information on how to set up a sponsored PTA, see the DoResearch website.\nd. Ongoing PTA Management\nCost-sharing PTAs are subject to the same PTA management procedures as described above for grant and contract PTAs.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nCost-sharing PTAs must be fully funded at the end of the University's fiscal year. Cost-sharing budgets and expenditures carry over to the new fiscal year, as described above for grant and contract PTAs.\nf. Closing a Cost Sharing PTA\nThe cost-sharing PTA is closed at the same time as the related grant or contract account, as described above.\n4. Gift PTA\na. Purpose\nA gift PTA is used to record the expenditures that execute the purpose of the gift.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe source of money for a gift fund may be a single gift or multiple gifts that have a common purpose and any related income generated by the gift itself or its associated endowment.\nc. Setting Up\nWhen a gift is received whose terms require the opening of a separate fund, the Department submits the Fund Accounting PTA Request form via email to their school/department Fund Accountant in the Controller's Office. They must also fax copies of the donor documentation and a Gift Transmittal Form to their fund accountant. The original donor correspondence regarding the restricted purpose of the gift and the original Gift Transmittal along with the donor check should be sent to Gift Processing. Never hold a donor check while waiting for a PTA. Fund Accounting, in consultation with the school, assigns a fund/award number and sets up the related expenditure Project and Task(s). Fund Accounting creates the Fund Authorization document that describes the purpose of the fund. If the gift creates a new endowment fund, Fund Accounting sets up a related expendable endowment income fund to receive the endowment income. The form used to request a new Gift PTA is located at here.\nFor step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA .\nd. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the balance of the gift fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expenditures exceed available funds in an expendable gift fund or an endowment income fund, a transfer from another appropriate fund restricted to departmental use must cover the overdraft. Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriate account to use.\ne. Closing a Gift PTA\n(1) Endowment\nEndowment gift funds and their related endowment income funds are very seldom closed. In the event that a PTA funded by an endowment income fund needs to be closed, the department should contact Fund Accounting. The account will be closed the first of the next month.\n(2) Expendable Gift PTAs\nAt any time during the year, departments may send a memo to Fund Accounting requesting that a PTA for an expendable gift fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n5. Designated Funds and Related PTA\na. Purpose\nDesignated funds generally contain unrestricted funds that the University (rather than a donor or sponsoring agency) has decided to use for a specific purpose.\nb. Source of Funds\nThere are two sorts of designated funds:(1) General funds that have been transferred to a department for a specific purpose, such as departmental research support.(2) Income that has been generated by the department and designated for departmental use. Examples are fees from professional services and conferences.\nc. Setting Up\nTo open a designated fund and related expenditure account, the department sends an email and Fund Accounting PTA Request Form to their school/department Fund Accounting. The form used to request a new PTA is located here. Fund Accounting, in consultation with the school, assigns a fund (award) number and sets up the related Project and Task(s) with the Fund Authorization information. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA.\nd. Changes to Fund Balances\nDesignated funds funded by general funds transfers are increased only by transfers from other University designated or unrestricted funds. That is, income cannot be deposited to this kind of fund.\nDesignated funds holding income are increased as cash receipts are deposited or transferred from other University designated or unrestricted funds.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the balance of the designated fund automatically carries over into the new year. If expenditures exceed available funds in a designated fund, a transfer from another appropriate fund must cover the overdraft. Consult with your fund accountant for the appropriate account to use.\nf. Closing a Designated Fund PTA\nAt any time during the year, the department may send an email to Fund Accounting requesting that a P, T, and/or A for a designated fund be closed to expense. The memo should include the reason for closing the PTA. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n6. Capital Asset Projects\na. Purpose\nCapital Asset projects capture expenditures related to facilities and infrastructure projects or computer hardware or software systems that require capitalization. They allow the University to categorize expenditures as capital assets or expenses and to collect expenditures in a way that supports indirect cost recovery, service center rate development and financial reporting.\nb. Source of Funds\nMultiple sources of funding may support a specific capital project. Examples are gifts, departmental funds, University unrestricted funds, University facilities reserves, debt, and Stanford Infrastructure Program funds.\nc. Setting Up\nA department planning a facilities construction or renovation project works with Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/Department of Capital Planning to initiate the project via the Facilities Form 1 System. When the project receives approval, a copy of the Facilities Form I and PTA set-up form is submitted to the Capital Accounting section of the Controller's Office. Capital Accounting reviews the Form 1 for necessary approvals, appropriateness of sources of funding and fund availability. It also sets up the PTA and sends out an Authorization memo, which includes the appropriate capital PTA, authorized budget, and applicable asset code for the project, notifying the appropriate individuals so they can grant signature authority on the PTA, as needed. For step-by-step instructions, see Quick Steps: Request New PTA.\nFor capital asset projects that do not involve facilities (e.g., computer hardware or software systems) the Capital Projects PTA Request Form should be completed and sent to Capital Accounting.\nd. Mid-Project Changes\nIf changes are needed to source of funds, the department informs Capital Accounting. Once funds are committed via the Form I, the department may not withdraw the funding commitment. However, a substitution of one fund source for another can be made.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAt fiscal year end the entire budget and expenditures for the project are carried forward to the new fiscal year expenditure statements. Expenditures must be fully funded. The department must work with Capital Accounting throughout the year to cover overdrafts.\nf. Closing a Capital Project\nThe project manager informs Capital Accounting that a project has been completed. Capital Accounting reconciles outstanding commitments, closes the project and award, and returns any unexpended funds to their original source.\n7. Student Aid PTA\nA student aid PTA is a special kind of PTA used to record departmental expenditures for student aid from current funds. Student aid PTAs are set up and managed in the same way as Operating Budget, gift, or designated PTAs, depending on the source of funds. See Quick Steps: Request New PTA.\nNote: Salaries to student employees and graduate research and teaching assistant tuition allowance are not student aid.\n8. Auxiliary PTA\na. Purpose\nAuxiliary enterprises are self-supporting entities that support the University's teaching and research mission. They service principally faculty, students, staff and the Stanford community. Major University auxiliaries include Housing and Dining Services, Stanford University Press, and the Department of Athletics.\nb. Source of Funds\nThe source of funds for auxiliary PTAs is the income generated by the auxiliary activity. The amount budgeted for the fiscal year is based on a forecast of expected income and expenses for the year.\nc. Setting Up\nTo set up a new auxiliary account, the department sends a memo to Fund Accounting with the appropriate information. The Fund Accounting PTA Request form is located here. \nd. PTA Management\nAuxiliaries are managed similarly to a business enterprise. In addition to income and expense activities, they may have assets, liabilities, and reserve (fund) PTAs.\ne. Fiscal Year End\nAny surplus or deficit is transferred at year-end to a reserve PTA of the auxiliary.\nf. Closing an Auxiliary P, T, and / or A\nAt any time during the year, the auxiliary may send a memo to Fund Accounting requesting that a P, T, and/or A for the auxiliary be closed. The memo should include the reason for closing the account. The PTA will be closed as of the first of the month following the month in which the memo is received, unless otherwise stipulated.\n9. Service Center PTA\na. Purpose\nA service center is an organizational unit of the University that provides a specific service, group of services, or products to users principally within the University. Large service centers include Information Technology Services (ITS), Land, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE), and the Medical School's Veterinary Service Center. Smaller service centers are typically found within academic departments. Detailed information on Service Centers is available at DoResearch.\nb. Authorization\nProposals for a new service center must have the approval of the department chair and school dean, or their equivalent for nonacademic areas. The Office of Research Administration Policy and Compliance (RAPC) is responsible for setting service center policy and reviewing annual budget submissions which should include the volume projection for services, and ensure the costs are compliant with Federal as well as University regulations. Review the Service Center Manual for additional information.\nc. Annual Breakeven\nAll service centers must annually break even, unless ONR has granted an exception. Twelve months of operational expense should be allocated to users via twelve months of allocation journals. If the year-end under-recovery exceeds 5% of expenses including the prior year balance for administrative service centers or 15% for academic service centers then either the users are charged the under-recovered amount or the service center's department will need to subsidize the entire loss. If the year-end over-recovery exceeds the 5% or 15% limit, a rebate must be allocated to all users of the service center. The breakeven calculation is fully explained here. \nd. Source of Funds\nThe costs of service center services or products are charged directly to all users based on the actual level of activity using a nondiscriminatory rate schedule. This rate schedule (the service center rate) must be calculated to recover no more or no less than the estimated aggregate cost of the service or product over a fiscal year unless otherwise agreed upon by the federal government.\ne. Setting Up\nWhen a new service center is reviewed and approved by RAPC, RAPC will open a new PTA. Some of the information required to open a new service center includes the purpose of the service center, anticipated usage, list of anticipated internal and external users, estimated initial budget, list of capital assets that will be required for the service center operation and a valid Guarantee PTA account. All academic service centers must have a guarantee account, which can be an operating budget, Dean's Executive fund, or unrestricted gift PTA designated by the school dean or department head. See the \"Request for Establishing a New Service Center\" PTA setup document.\nf. Mid-Year Changes\nRequests to change a service center rate should be made as soon as it appears an administrative service center will not break even within +/-5% at year-end or an academic service center will not break even within +/-15% at year-end using the previously approved rates. Such requests much be routed to the appropriate service center analyst for review and approval before the new rate can be used. A list of service center analysts is available online.\ng. Fiscal Year End\nService center balances at fiscal year end must be within +/- 5% of an administrative service center's annual expenditures, including the prior year balance and +/- 15% of an academic service center's annual expenditures, including prior year balances. When any over-recovery exceeds break-even percentage, the entire surplus balance must be refunded to all users in an equitable manner. When any under-recovery exceeds the applicable percentage, the entire deficit balance must be cleared either by either charging the service center's Guarantee PTA or by allocating a yearend assessment of the entire loss to all users on a prorated usage basis. Service centers that operate under special long-term break-even or pricing agreements with the government will not be required to break even at year-end.\nh. Closing a Service Center PTA\nThe department will need to clear any remaining balance before RAPC can close the service center PTA.\n10. Expenditure Allocation PTA\na. Purpose\nAn expenditure allocation (expense clearing) PTA is a departmental expenditure PTA used to accumulate specific costs as a means of expediting the processing of accounting transactions. Expenditure allocation PTAs are used when the final distribution of expenses is unknown at the time the expenses are incurred. Expenditure allocation PTAs are cleared via iJournals or Labor Distribution adjustments. Labor and material costs cannot be combined in the same expenditure allocation PTA. If labor and material expenses must be combined, the department should establish a service center PTA (see section 9). For related information, see AGM 3.2.3: Allocation and Offsets. Please refer to the DoResearch site for additional guidance on the use of expenditure allocation PTAs.\nb. Authorization\nExpenditure allocation PTAs must have the approval of the requesting department's Administrative Service Manager and an individual with financial authority over the guarantee PTA.\nc. Source of Funds\nThe requesting department must identify and provide resources to guarantee the expenditure allocation PTA. Funds from sponsored awards may not be used as the guarantee. Guarantees generally come from unrestricted, gift, endowment income, or designated funds. The fund source will be used to guarantee any uncleared expenses at the end of the fiscal year.\nd. Setting Up\nWhen a department needs a new expenditure allocation PTA it requests Research Administration Policy and Compliance (RAPC) to set it up by submitting the Request For Expenditure Allocation PTA form. RAPC will review the allocation method(s) to be used by the account administrator and maintain records to support the establishment of the PTA.\n11. Receivables PTA\nA department that administers a program such as a conference or professional journal sponsored by an organization outside the University must use a receivables PTA for expenses incurred on campus. Operating budgets, designated funds and restricted funds cannot be used for such activities. To open a receivables account, contact the Receivables Accounting section of the Controller's Office.\n12. Account Maintenance\nCertain information gathered at the time the account is established may change over time. The information includes the Owner, Manager and Owning-Organization of the Project, Task and Award. This information is crucial to reporting on and analyzing financial activity and may impact authority and approvals. When a change occurs due to turnover or business reorganization the department must update PTA roles and owning, as described at Stanford's Gateway to Financial Activities."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/administrative-guide-policy-541-expense-advances", "text": "5.4.1 Expense Advances | Administrative Guide\nSkip to main content Skip to secondary navigation \nLast Updated\nJanuary 08, 2019 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36.3\nThis Guide Memo outlines policy on advancing funds for University activities. It should be used in conjunction with resources and procedural information on the Gateway to Financial Activities website, including Guidelines for Advances and the How-To listing in the Reimbursement section.\n1. Funds Advanced for Business Expenses\na. Purpose of Expense Advances\nThe use of cash advances is expected to be rare, but may be appropriate to further University business under certain circumstances including:\nPaying for travel (e.g., airfare or pre-paid lodging) for students, staff, and faculty who travel infrequently on University business,\nFunding incentives for Human Subjects, or\nFinancial hardship\nAs a preferred alternative to an expense advance, the University has a travel card program described on the Gateway to Financial Activities website. Any other advance request not explicitly listed above is considered an exception and requires prior approval by the Business Expense Manager within Procurement Services. The University does not allow expense advances for personal reasons. \nb. Authorizing and Issuing Funds\nExpense advances are authorized by departments, and are issued to the individual who will be incurring expenses. Responsibility for the University funds remains with the individual until expenditures are accounted for through an expense report in the Expense Requests system.\nc. Amount of Expense Advances\nThe amount advanced may not exceed the estimated cash required for the activity. All advances for travel must include supporting documentation detailing the estimated travel expenses.\nHuman Subject incentives greater than $200 per subject cannot be advanced and must be processed as a direct non-purchase order payment in the Expense Requests system.\n2. Requesting an Expense Advance\na. Initiating a Request\nThe department initiates a request for an advance online using the Expense Requests system. See How To: Create Advance Request.\nb. Timing of Request\nApproved expense advances must be received by the Business Expense department at least 10 working days before the date the funds are needed. Fees will be charged for expedited (\u201cRush\u201d) delivery of funds or if pickup at the \"Will Call\" window is requested.\nc. Delivery of Funds\nChecks for expense advances may be delivered by interdepartmental mail to the department, sent via U.S. Mail, deposited directly to the payee's bank account, or picked up at designated \u201cWill Call\u201d locations.\n3. Expense Reporting\na. Expense Reporting\nAn expense report must be submitted in the Expense Requests system no later than 60 days after the completion of the activity (e.g., trip) in order to clear advances. Absent exceptional circumstances, expenses submitted more than 60 days after the date of completion will be reported as taxable income to the individual. See How To: Clear an Advance.\nb. Returning Unused Funds\nUnused funds, and funds that are no longer needed, must be promptly returned to the University. \nIf an advance is outstanding more than 60 days past the expected clearing date, the advance will be reported as taxable income to the individual to whom the advance was intended. In this circumstance, the advance will be expensed to the account specified in the advance request. The department is responsible for determining if the advance has been charged to the appropriate account.\nThe advance recipient will not be eligible to receive any future advances if the advance was not properly cleared.\nSee How To: Return Unused Advance Funds."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/policy/administrative-guide-policy-219-separation-employment", "text": "2.1.9 Separation from Employment | Administrative Guide\nLast Updated\nAugust 24, 2018 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 22.8\nThis Guide Memo outlines Stanford University's policies and procedures for carrying out the separation of employment for regular employees and academic staff.\nApplicability:\nApplies to all regular employees and academic staff as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. For policies that apply to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, refer to the agreements at Labor Relations & Collective Bargaining. For additional provisions that may apply to certain members of the academic staff, consult with the appropriate local Human Resources office. While policy statements apply to the entire University including SLAC, some specific procedures given here do not apply at SLAC. Employees should contact the SLAC Human Resources Department for information on separation procedures at SLAC.\n1. Policy Statement\nIt is the goal of the University to separate regular employees and academic staff from University employment as appropriate and necessary and in conformance with all laws and regulations. To that end, the policies and procedures in this Guide Memo will be followed.\n2. Resignation\na. Definition\nA resignation is a voluntary termination of employment initiated by the employee. Resignations should be confirmed in writing (see Guide to Supervisors below). A confirmed resignation may be withdrawn at the sole discretion and written approval of the supervisor and the local Human Resources office.\nb. Guide to Supervisors\nFor planning purposes the University requests that employees notify their supervisors as soon as possible of any intention to resign. At least two weeks' prior notice of resignation is expected from non-exempt employees. At least four weeks' prior notice is expected from exempt employees. Supervisors should request that the employee submit a written statement of resignation that includes the date of, and reasons for the resignation. If the employee does not provide a written statement, the supervisor should confirm the oral resignation in writing.\nAt the supervisor's discretion, along with approval from the local Human Resources Manager, the employee's resignation date may be advanced to an earlier date and pay in lieu of notice given for the remainder of the expected notice period (two weeks for non-exempt employees; four weeks for exempt employees). Pay in lieu of notice may not exceed four weeks.\n3. Retirement\na. Definition\nRetirement occurs when an employee who meets the eligibility requirements for an Official University Retiree voluntarily terminates from employment. See Guide Memo 2.1.10: Staff Retirement.\nb. Guide to Supervisors\nUpon notification of an employee's intended retirement, supervisors should counsel employee to attend a Retirement Workshop presented by the Benefits Department at least 2-3 months before retirement. Find a list of dates and times at the Benefits website in the Events Calendar section.\n4. Death\nIn the event of an employee's death, the supervisor should notify Stanford Benefits and the local Human Resources office as soon as possible. All employees in benefits-eligible positions (working at least 50% time) are covered by no less than basic life insurance of one times pay up to a $50,000 maximum. See Guide Memo 2.3.1: Survivor Benefit Plans, and corresponding plan summaries.\n5. Conclusion of a Fixed-Term Appointment\na. Definition\nA fixed-term appointment is an appointment for which a planned termination date is established and recorded at the time the employee is hired or appointed.\nb. Policy\nAn employee hired or appointed for a fixed-term is terminated by the department at the end of the appointment unless an extension or reappointment has been approved.\n(1) Notice\nAt the time of appointment, the department is to notify a fixed-term employee in writing of the planned termination date. Most Academic Staff appointments have additional requirements regarding notice of either non-renewal or renewal. Consult with the policies specific to those appointments for further guidance.\n(2) Grievance Procedure Not Applicable\nA termination occurring because of the expiration of a fixed-term appointment is not considered a discharge for cause and not subject to any grievance procedure.\n(3) Separation Prior to Planned Termination Date\nA fixed-term employee may be involuntarily terminated for cause or laid off before the planned termination date of their fixed-term appointment. See Guide Memo 2.1.17: Layoffs and Guide Memo 2.1.16: Addressing Conduct & Performance Issues.\n6. Discharge\na. Definition\nA discharge is an involuntary termination of employment from the University.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-831-capital-projects", "text": "8.3.1 Capital Projects | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 83\nThis Guide Memo describes Stanford University policy on initiating academic facilities and infrastructure projects under the authority of Land, Buildings,and Real Estate (LBRE), including specific information on the allocation, siting and management of modular buildings, trailers and storage containers on campus. This Guide Memo also addresses University funding of capital projects, including the application of the Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) assessment and the General Use Permit (GUP) Entitlement Fee to fund mitigation costs arising from the approval of the December 2000 Community Plan and the General Use Permit.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all University capital projects.\n1. Facilities Project Initiation\na. Form 1 Required for Capital Projects\nAll requests for academic facilities and infrastructure projects on the Stanford University campus, where Stanford occupies or leases buildings off the campus are required to be submitted electronically on a Form 1 prior to the project's start. \nThe Form 1 is required, but not limited, to the following types of academic projects, regardless of size, cost or funding source. A detailed list of project types requiring a Form 1 is available on the Land, Buildings and Real Estate website.\nNew construction, including construction or placement of temporary buildings intended for personnel occupancy\nRenovation\nBuilding demolitions\nInterior building changes\nProjects that affect building exteriors\nSurge and relocation projects associated with a capital project\nLandscape projects and reconfigurations\nLand use projects\nProjects requiring a jurisdictional permit and plan check. Projects requiring only over-the-counter permits may not require a Form 1\nProjects undertaken and/or funded by Capital Utilities Program (CUP), (GUP) Entitlement Fee Program, Capital Facilities Fund (CFF), Facilities Reserve, and debt\nThe Form 1 applicability list is not exhaustive but is intended to capture a wide range of activities that are closely monitored by Stanford. In cases where ambiguity exists, with respect to Form 1 applicability and/or capitalization rules, it is the responsibility of the project initiator to seek clarification.\nThe following types of projects are exempted from the Form 1 process:\nProperties and land designated for income production by the Board of Trustees\nNon-capital and/or Board of Trustee approved capital projects managed by Stanford Health Care and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory unless University funding or facilities are involved\nCommercial and residential ground leases\nFaculty staff housing rental purchases\nMaintenance projects that do not include a capitalized component, and do not qualify under any of the criteria mentioned above\nThe Form 1 request process enables Land, Buildings, and Real Estate to:\nDetermine whether Board of Trustees approval is applicable\nEvaluate program scope, justification and priority\nAssess and confirm the funding resources that are available (through the Controller's Office)\nEnsure that campus planning, code, architectural and aesthetic considerations are reviewed\nEnsure that Stanford's Project Delivery Process is followed (see Project Delivery Process for detailed information on the process) \nRequest a PTA (Project/Task/Award) setup in Oracle allowing contracts and expenditures to commence\nb. Process\nThe Form 1 process is initiated by authorized local facilities representatives before a project begins, is then approved within the School/Department, and is finally submitted electronically on the Land, Buildings, and Real Estate website. Detailed approval guidelines, at various project cost levels, are outlined in detail on the Form 1 website.\n2. Modular Buildings and Trailers\na. New Modulars and Trailers\nFor reasons of cost effectiveness, sustainability and campus aesthetics, modulars and trailers are generally discouraged as a Stanford University building type. However, there are times when modulars are appropriate for temporary use on campus.\nb. Process\nProposals to install new modulars and trailers need to be submitted using Capital Planning's Space Request Form and approved by the Provost. This form is required prior to initiating the Form 1 process, regardless of modular or trailer size, proposed length of use, purpose, cost, location, or source of funding. The cost and installation of new modulars and trailers generally are the responsibility of the local area.\nSiting of all modulars and trailers must be approved by the Stanford University Architect/Planning Office.\nDetailed policies on modular buildings and trailers can be found on the Capital Planning website.\n3. Storage Containers\na. Definition\nStorage containers are freestanding metal boxes used for a variety of stored materials. They are centrally located in the storage container yard and adjacent area on Stock Farm Road. Locating containers in other areas of the campus must be approved in advance by the Stanford University Architect/Planning Office.\nb. Process\nProposals for the installation of new containers and moving existing storage containers need to be submitted on Capital Planning's Space Request Form for approval by the Provost. This form is required prior to initiating the Form 1 process, regardless of container size, cost, proposed length of use or source of funding. The cost and installation of new containers is the responsibility of the local area. Units wishing to relinquish or move containers also must inform Capital Planning in advance. The cost and removal of containers is the responsibility of the local area.\nSiting of all storage containers must be approved by the Stanford University Architect/Planning Office.\nDetailed policies on storage containers can be found on the Capital Planning website.\n4. Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) Assessment\nThe Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) consists of campus planning and transportation projects and programs for the improvement and general support of the University's academic community, hospitals, and its physical plant. Program funding is generated by an internal fee levied on monthly expenditures of all academic and hospital capital projects, as described below. The program facilitates the construction of bicycle and pedestrian paths, lighting, outdoor art, campus transit, roads and parking lot infrastructure, connective elements, and other site improvements that directly supports the academic missions of teaching and research and the overall vitality of the institution. This infrastructure will be developed as necessary to improve public safety and service, and to promote conservation in land use and resources.\na. Assessment\nA 4.6% SIP assessment is applied on all expenditures (excluding fees for SIP, GUP Entitlement, Below Market Rate Housing (BMR), and the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD)) for capital projects (including new buildings, renovations, deferred maintenance and the CUP), regardless of amount, funding or management. \nFor Stanford Health Care and Welch Road academic tenants in the City of Palo Alto, the SIP assessment is 2.3% on all expenditures (excluding fees for SIP, GUP Entitlement, Below Market Rate Housing (BMR), Palo Alto Union School District (PAUSD), computer hardware and software, medical equipment and furniture, and off-campus capital projects) for capital projects (including new buildings, renovations, deferred maintenance and CUP), regardless of amount, funding or management. The SIP percentage is lower for the aforementioned entities as they are required to provide and fund parking for their properties in the City of Palo Alto (i.e. SIP funds are unavailable in the City of Palo Alto).\nNo assessments will be taken on SIP-funded or GUP Entitlement Fee funded projects, or software application programs.\nb. Project Eligibility\nAny academic or auxiliary program may identify a need for a potential SIP project and seek SIP funding by submitting a project request to either the University Architect/Planning & Design office (SIP-C) or the Stanford Transportation office (SIP-T) as appropriate. Each request must represent a project that will provide benefits to more than a single campus user, group, or building and each will be evaluated against the following general criteria:\nImproves the overall quality of the campus environment\nSatisfies a particular academic or auxiliary program need\nReduces total capital and operating budget expenses\nFulfills a safety and/or security need\nRelates to and supports campus planning objectives\nProvides a renewal of a deteriorating infrastructure asset(s)\nResponds to governmental agency requirements\nc. More information\nDetailed guidelines regarding SIP can be found in the Document Library on the LBRE website.\n5. General Use Permit (GUP) Entitlement Fee\nThe GUP Entitlement Fee provides funding for the mitigation of projects and programs (Conditions of Approval) required by Santa Clara County as a result of the December 2000 Community Plan and GUP approval. The projects and programs required include infrastructure and environmental resource studies, a comprehensive water conservation program, transportation demand management, habitat conservation, and consultant monitoring of mitigation compliance. Additionally, GUP Entitlement Fees fund the cost of roadway expansions, new parking, and expanded childcare facilities.\na. Assessment\nA GUP Entitlement Fee is assessed on increases in School/Department gross square footage on the Stanford campus regardless of total project value. Housing units are required as a component of the GUP and are thus excluded from the GUP Entitlement Fee.\nThe entitlement fee structure is based upon the present net value of projected mitigation costs, as described above. The fee will be set on a rolling three-year basis consistent with the Capital Plan and may be revised periodically. The forecasted rates for current and future GUP Entitlement Fees can be accessed on the Capital Projects Fees table.\nb. Space Audit\nAlthough increases in School/Department square footage typically result from the construction of a new building, a variety of other factors may impact the square footage calculation to derive net incremental program growth. Any project that results in additional square footage will be subject to a space audit to determine the total amount of growth. The audit will consider a combination of space movements, including, but not limited to, space demolitions, vacated and reassigned space, and inherited space.\nAll space changes are subject to the approval of the Provost.\n6. Funding Policy\nAll capital projects, regardless of total project budget, must have funding in hand or an approved backstopping plan prior to commencing construction. All capital project funding requests are initiated via the Form 1 process. Funding is transferred to an account established by the Controller\u2019s Office. Form 1s may be approved by the Vice President of LBRE, or the Associate Vice President, Land and Buildings Academic Projects and Operations (up to a total project cost of $10 million). If the project was not approved in the Capital Plan and/or GUP square feet, central funding or centrally funded debt are requested, and were not previously allocated, the Form 1 must be routed to the Provost for approval. \na. Capital Projects under $25 million\nCapital projects that have a total capital project cost up to $15 million must obtain Concept and Construction Approval from the Vice President of LBRE.\nCapital projects that have a total capital project up to $25 million must obtain Concept and Construction Approval from the Provost.\nCapital projects presented to the Provost or the Vice President LBRE must have a final Funding Plan prior to the request for Concept Approval, and a final Funding Agreement prior to the request for Construction Approval.\nThe detailed Capital Project Approval Process and Related Funding Documentation Policy for capital projects less than $25 million can be found in the Document Library on the LBRE website.\nb. Capital Projects over $25 million\nIf any of the following criteria are met, the project must go to the Board of Trustees for approval:\nConstruction, renovation or building improvements projects for academic use, on or within University-owned land, that have a financial commitment greater than $25 million;\nare for the creation of new development on a previously undeveloped site;\nor will result in the change in use of an existing site must obtain several levels of approval from the Committee on Land and Buildings of the Board of Trustees.\nAs documented in the Project Delivery Process, a percentage of the total project budget is transferred to the account by the Controller\u2019s Office at each Board-required approval. Approval levels include Concept, Project, and Construction for building renovations; and Concept/Site, Design, and Construction for renovations, and Concept and Site, Design, and Construction for new buildings. All projects presented to the Committee on Land and Buildings must have an executed Funding Plan prior to the request for Concept Approval, and an executed Funding Agreement no later than the request for Construction Approval.\nInfrastructure programs with program funding identified (e.g., the CUP, SIP, GUP Entitlement Fee program) generally do not need separate funding plans and agreements; however, individual projects exceeding $25 million may require approval from the Board of Trustees.\nThe Funding Plan outlines the benchmarked project budget, the planned funding sources, and the estimated amounts from each funding source; addresses the budget responsibility for finance charges during construction, as well as debt servicing or gift backstopping provisions after construction completion; addresses restrictions on the use of tax-exempt debt; documents O&M impacts and unit responsible, and stipulates if a project is subject to a GUP Entitlement Fee. Funding Plans are subject to revision if the project experiences significant changes in project scope or budget during the design phase.\nThe Funding Agreement supersedes the Funding Plan when the project returns to the Committee on Land and Buildings of the Board of Trustees for Construction Approval documenting final components listed in the previous paragraph.\nThe detailed Capital Project Funding Plans and Agreements Policy can be found in the Document Library on the LBRE website.\n7.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-policy-411-gifts-university", "text": "4.1.1 Gifts to the University\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 41\nStanford University relies upon gifts from alumni, parents of students, friends, corporations, associations, and foundations to meet a substantial portion of its operating costs. This Guide Memo outlines policies on procurement, classification, management, and use of gifts.\n1. Definition\nA gift is any item of value given to the University by a donor who expects nothing of value in return, other than recognition (for example, being listed on an honor roll or naming a building, fund, professorship, etc. in the donor's honor).\na. \"Quid Pro Quo\" Situations\nIf the University has given something of value in return for a gift, the donor's tax deduction is reduced by the fair market value of the benefit received. All \"quid pro quo\" gifts or gift solicitations must be reported to and cleared with the Office of Development. Contact Gift Processing, (650) 725-4360, or the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, in the Office of Development for further information.\nb. Non-Gifts\n(1) Sponsored Projects\nConsult the Research Policy Handbook 13.1 for the distinction between gifts and sponsored projects.\n(2) Income\nPayment received for goods or services must be handled as income. See Guide Memo 1.5.3: Unrelated Business Activities.\n(3) Non-Gift Financial Aid for a Named Student\nSupport received from an outside individual or institution for the purpose of paying the tuition or other educational expenses of a specifically named student, where the University has no discretion in the assignment of the funds for any other student(s), is actually a gift to the specifically-named individual rather than to the University, and is accounted for by Stanford as Student Financial Aid. Such checks are to be sent, along with all accompanying documentation, to the Financial Aid Office, which will appropriately account for the payment.\n2. General Information\na. Designation of Gifts to Stanford\nAll gifts, regardless of value, form, or designated use, should be made payable to, or title should be transferred in the name of, Stanford University or the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University. However, donors of securities can facilitate Stanford's gift processing effort by not re-registering the securities before giving them to the University.\nb. Recording of Gifts\nAll gifts of cash, securities, real estate, and capital equipment are recorded at market value as of the date of the gift by the Gift Processing section of the Office of Development and/or the Controller's Office. (See Guide Memos 4.2.2: Acknowledgement of Gifts and 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment.) Gifts of tangible personal property (other than capital equipment covered under Guide Memo 4.2.3) may be recorded if Development Services receives adequate documentation, including sufficient information for valuation. \nc. Information About Gifts\nQuestions about methods of giving, assignment, acknowledgment, recording, restrictions on, or purpose of a gift should be directed to the Office of Development. Questions about legal documentation, tax benefits, or requirements for gifts should be directed to the Office of Planned Giving, Office of Development, 326 Galvez Street, (650) 725-4358.\n3. Responsibilities\na. Board of Trustees\nThe Board of Trustees is the legal entity to which all gifts to the University are made and has responsibility for ensuring that gifts are properly accepted (or refused), processed, acknowledged, and used according to their terms and restrictions and in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal laws.\nb. University President and Provost\nThe President and Provost have ultimate administrative responsibility for determining the use of both unrestricted and restricted gifts, setting priorities for gift fundraising, and reviewing and setting policies concerning gifts, in consultation with the Board of Trustees.\nc. Vice President for Development\nThe Vice President is responsible for managing the University's gift procurement and processing operations, for coordinating the fundraising operations of all Schools and Institutes, and for implementing policies set by the Board of Trustees, the Provost, and the President.\n4. Affiliated Organizations\nCertain groups affiliated with Stanford that raise funds for University purposes may derive tax-deductible status for donors' contributions if gifts are made to and processed through the University. Such groups are encouraged to contact and consult with the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, prior to conducting any fundraising effort or event to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws as well as with University policy.\na. Stanford Associates\nThis group of Stanford alumni and friends was formed in 1935 to encourage financial support of the University and recognize those donors who make important contributions, either in terms of money or time. For information please contact Stanford Associates at 326 Galvez, (650) 725-4340.\nb. Student Organizations\nStudent organizations must apply to the ASSU Office of Student Activities at Stanford University as well as the Office of Development prior to soliciting potential donors, and work in conjunction with the Office of Development to plan and implement their fundraising efforts. Student organizations registered with the Office of Student Activities that receive gifts should contact the ASSU administrator to arrange for processing of those gifts through the University's gift processing system.\n5. Gift Procurement Policies\na. Gift Classification\n(1) Cash and Checks\n(preferably made payable to Stanford University).\n(2) Noncash Gifts\nBesides cash and checks, Stanford receives noncash gifts described below. Donors should be aware that tax laws distinguish between certain types of gifts for purposes of determining their charitable contribution deduction (see Section 5).\nMarketable Property \u2014 Gifts that are readily sold such as securities (e.g., stocks and bonds), real estate, and salable personal property.\nGifts in Kind \u2014 Gifts to be used in the form in which they are given, such as art objects, books, equipment, etc.\nRights and Insurance \u2014 Gifts which assign to the University the right to receive payments such as royalties or licensing fees, or that vest ownership in copyrights or trademark rights, and insurance policies that name the University as a beneficiary.\nb. Donor Designation of Gift Use\n(1) Expendable and Endowment Gifts\nA gift may be designated by the donor as expendable (i.e., immediately usable for current purposes), or as endowment (i.e., to be invested and held in perpetuity, with only the Board determined payout available to support University purposes). While donor intent is usually clear, certain types of gifts, such as bequests, may need additional research. Gifts will be recorded as expendable unless there is specific indication otherwise. Expendable gifts are invested in the Expendable Funds Pool; see Guide Memo 3.3.2: Expendable Funds Investment and Payout, for more information. Endowment gifts are invested in one of the University's merged pools depending on the donor's terms; contact Fund Accounting at (650) 723-9773 for more information. For further advice concerning donor designation of expendable and endowment gifts, contact the Office of Planned Giving in the Office of Development, (650) 725-4358.\n(2) Purpose\nAbsent stipulations of purpose from the donor, gifts will be recorded as unrestricted expendable funds to support University purposes. If the donor designates a specific purpose for use of the gift (e.g., scholarships, student housing, a particular department, etc.) then the gift is considered to be restricted and the University is responsible for assuring that restrictions on use are honored unless (i) the donor specifically waives the restriction or (ii) court approval to change or void the restriction is granted. Approval to seek changes in the purpose of a gift fund by the above means can only be granted by the Provost; contact the Office of Planned Giving for instructions, (650) 725-4358.\n(3) Establishing a Fund\nThe department is responsible for instructing Gift Processing whether an existing fund should be credited with a gift (in which case, the fund number must be supplied), or whether a new fund should be established. Gifts with different restrictions may not be commingled in a common fund. If the donor designates a specific purpose and/or named fund, and no appropriate fund already exists, the department should forward the gift and all relevant original documentation to Gift Processing. Gift Processing will then coordinate with the Fund Accounting section of the Controller's Office, which establishes funds and records restrictions. Contact Fund Accounting for questions relating to a particular fund, (650) 723-9773.\n6. Tax Considerations\nThe Internal Revenue Service has several requirements that relate to donor tax deductions for cash and noncash gifts to charities.\na. Receipts\nIt is Stanford's policy to issue receipts for all gifts (see Guide Memo 4.2.2: Acknowledgement of Gifts). The IRS requires a receipt to substantiate most charitable contribution deductions. The donor should retain the receipt in their records; it need not be filed with the tax return.\nb. Deductibility\nGifts to Stanford University are usually deductible at their full fair market value as of the date of the gift for both state and federal tax purposes. One important exception to this rule is that for gifts of tangible personal property that are intended to be resold by the University, the donor is entitled to an income tax deduction that is the lesser of the item's fair market value or the donor's cost basis. Contact the Office of Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358 for more information. Tax laws governing charitable gifts are complex; the University encourages donors to seek professional advice on tax issues.\nc. Noncash Charitable Contributions (IRS Form 8283)\n(1) Noncash Gifts Over $500\nIf a donors wishes to claim an income tax deduction of $500 or more in any year for gifts to charity which are not cash, then the donor must file IRS Form 8283 (Noncash Charitable Contributions) with their federal income tax return. Form 8283 is available from the Office of Planned Giving.\n(2) Noncash Gifts Over $5,000\nIn addition, if a donor wishes to claim charitable income tax deductions totaling $5,000 or more in any tax year for gifts that are not cash or publicly traded securities, then the donor needs to obtain qualified appraisals of the property donated and Stanford must acknowledge receipt by signing the IRS Form 8283, which the donor then files with their federal income taxes along with the qualified appraisal in certain cases. Donor should consult with their tax advisors on the filing requirements. Normally Stanford cannot provide or pay for an appraisal for a donor's tax purposes, nor will the University attempt to estimate the fair market value of any real or personal property gift.\nForm 8283 is processed either through the Property Management Office (PMO) (for gifts of capital equipment) or the Office of Development (for all other noncash gifts) and signed by the Accounting Officer in the Controller's Office. The individual accepting the gift should make sure that the donor's name and Social Security number are on the Form 8283, and that the Accounting Officer is provided with the donor's address. It is the donor's responsibility to notify the University that they will require Stanford's acknowledgment on Form 8283.\n(3) Gifts of Securities\nSecurities Not Publicly Traded\nA qualified appraisal and Stanford's acknowledgment of receipt on IRS Form 8283 are required for gifts of securities that are not publicly traded if their total value is more than $10,000.\nPublicly Traded Securities\nAdditional documentation is not required for gifts of publicly traded securities (regardless of their value).\nd. Donee Information Return (IRS Form 8282)\nUnder certain circumstances described below, if Stanford sells, transfers, exchanges or otherwise disposes of donated property within two years of the date of receipt of the property, Stanford must file Form 8282 (Donee Information Return) with the IRS reporting such action. A department that becomes aware of such a disposition should immediately notify the Property Management Office (for capital equipment) or the Accounting Officer in the Controller's Office (for all other property). Among the information required is the name of the donor, their address and tax ID or Social Security number, and any amount received upon disposition. If the transfer is made to a successor donee (that is, another nonprofit entity), information concerning that donee must be included as well. Form 8282 must be filed with the IRS within 125 days of the date of disposition (except as noted in 5.d.(3) below), with a copy to the donor. The Accounting Officer is responsible for preparation of the Form 8282 and its transmittal to the IRS and to the donor. This filing requirement applies only to the following items of donated property or equipment:\nProperty for which Stanford has completed the donee acknowledgment section of the donor's IRS Form 8283 (see above section 5.c.(2)).\nProperty that is considered a restricted donation under Section 170 (e)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. This consists of donated equipment where Stanford has committed 80 percent of its use for research, experimentation, or research training conducted in the United States, in the physical or biological sciences.\nProperty for which Stanford has not completed the donee acknowledgment section of the donor's IRS Form 8283 but which the University later becomes aware should have been so substantiated, e.g. where such property had a fair market value of more than $5,000 as of the date of donation and the donor failed to submit Form 8283 to Stanford for acknowledgment. In this case Form 8282 must be filed within 60 days from the date that the University becomes aware of the omission.\n7. Getting Help\nQuestions about deductibility of gifts, IRS Forms 8282 and 8283, and other tax questions should be referred to the Office of Planned Giving, Office of Development, 326 Galvez, (650) 725-4358."}

Gift Receipts\nAll gifts to Stanford of cash, checks, and securities, as well as most other types of gifts, are officially acknowledged by the University through the Office of Development. It is the Office of Development's goal to issue a receipt to the donor within 10 working days after Development Services has been notified and received relevant documentation for each gift. Receipts issued by Development Services conform to certain government mandated format requirements, including a statement as to whether the donor has received anything of value in return for the gift and, where applicable, a reference to the University's charge on restricted funds (see Guide Memo 3.3.1: Infrastructure Charges). Under Federal law donors must possess a conforming gift receipt in order to claim a tax deduction for most charitable contributions.\na. Monetary Gifts\nReceipts state the dollar value of the gift.\nb. Securities Gifts\nReceipts describe the number and type of securities donated, and as a courtesy to the donor will generally state the value of any publicly-traded securities credited to the donor's gift record. The value claimed by the donor for tax purposes is the donor's responsibility.\nc. Other Nonmonetary Gifts\nReceipts describe the gift in reasonably specific terms, including number and type of property involved, but do not include a valuation. The value claimed by the donor for tax purposes is the donor's responsibility. For equipment gifts, see Guide Memo 4.2.3: Records of Donated Equipment. Receipts for gifts of real estate are issued by the Office of Development in coordination with the Gift Real Estate section of the Stanford Management Company.\nd. \"Quid Pro Quo\" Gifts\nUnder federal law, receipts for gifts made to Stanford where the University has given the donor something of value in return must state this fact on the University's gift receipt and must include a valuation of the benefit received by the donor. The donor's tax deduction is reduced by this amount. These requirements do not apply to certain narrowly defined nominal items given in return for a gift (contact Development Services, (650) 725-4360, or Planned Giving, (650) 725-4358, for information).\ne. Life Income Gifts\nPlanned Giving in the Office of Development is responsible for preparing and issuing receipts for life income gifts.\n2. Acknowledgment Letters\nIn addition to the University's official gift receipt, certain gifts are acknowledged by a letter signed by the President of the University and/or the Vice President for Development, a School Dean, a Director of a Center, or the Chair of the Board of Trustees. Stewardship Officers throughout the University have the responsibility for tracking gifts that meet certain criteria (which vary slightly from area to area and by signer) and drafting letters for the appropriate signature."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/authority/policy/administrative-guide-policy-111-university-code-conduct", "text": "1.1.1 University Code of Conduct\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 1\nThis Guide Memo defines the University's Code of Conduct.\nApplicability:\nThe Code applies to these groups of people, referred to as members of the Stanford University Community:\nFaculty, staff, students and postdoctoral scholars of Stanford University;\nMembers of the Board of Trustees;\nConsultants, contractors and others, when performing services for the University or interacting with members of the University Community, acting on behalf of the University, or otherwise required under contract to comply with this Code; and\nIndividuals who perform services for the University as volunteers.\n1. Introduction and Purpose\na. Introduction\nAll members of the University Community are responsible for sustaining the high ethical standards of this institution, and of the broader community in which we function. The University values integrity, diversity, respect, freedom of inquiry and expression, trust, honesty and fairness and strives to integrate these values into its education, research, health care and business practices.\nb. Purpose\nIn that spirit, this Code is a shared statement of our commitment to upholding the ethical, professional and legal standards we use as the basis for our daily and long-term decisions and actions. We all must be aware of and comply with the relevant policies, standards, laws and regulations that guide our work. We are each individually accountable for our own actions and, as members of the University Community, are collectively accountable for upholding these standards of behavior and for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and policies.\n2. Standards of Integrity and Quality\nStanford recognizes that it must earn and maintain a reputation for integrity that includes, but is not limited to, compliance with laws and regulations and its contractual obligations. Even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can be damaging to the University. Stanford must strive at all times to maintain the highest standards of integrity and quality.\nThere are times when Stanford's business activities and other conduct of its University Community members are not governed by specific laws or regulations. In these instances, rules of fairness, honesty, and respect for the rights of others will govern our conduct at all times.\nIn addition, each individual is required to conduct University business transactions with the utmost honesty, accuracy and fairness. Each situation needs to be examined in accordance with this standard. No unethical practice can be tolerated, even if such practice is \"customary\" outside of Stanford or even if some of the goals it serves are worthy. Expediency should never compromise integrity.\n3. Respect for Others\nStanford University is an institution dedicated to the pursuit of excellence and facilitation of an environment that fosters this goal. Central to that institutional commitment is the principle of treating each University Community member fairly and with respect, and embracing diversity and inclusion. See Statement from the President and Provost on Advancing Free Speech and Inclusion.\nThe University prohibits discrimination and harassment and provides equal opportunities for all Community members and applicants regardless of their race, color, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, reproductive health decision-making, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, military status, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law. Where actions are found to have occurred that violate this standard the University will take prompt action to cease the offending conduct, prevent its recurrence and discipline those responsible. Find policies in support of this standard at these locations:\nGeneral Employment Policies\nFaculty Handbook 4.2 Statement on Academic Freedom\nPolicy on Sexual Harassment\nPolicy on Consensual Sexual or Romantic Relationships in the Workplace and Educational Setting\nPolicies on Prohibited Sexual Conduct: Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Assault, Stalking Relationship Violence, Violation of University Court Directives, Student-on-Student Sexual Harassment and Retaliation\nPolicy on Equal Employment Opportunity, Non-Discrimination, and Affirmative Action\nPolicy for Protection of Minors\nProtected Identity Harm Reporting\nDiversity & Access Office\nSexual Harassment Policy Office\n4. Compliance with Laws and Applicable Policies and Procedures\nMembers of the Stanford University Community must transact University business in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and University policy and procedure. Managers and supervisors are responsible for teaching and monitoring compliance. When questions arise pertaining to interpretation or applicability of policy, contact the individual who has oversight of the policy. Refer all unresolved questions and/or interpretation of laws and regulations to the Office of the General Counsel. University-wide policy documents can be found at policy.stanford.edu.\na. Contractual, Grant and Other Obligations\nThe acceptance of an agreement, including sponsored project funding, may create a legal obligation on the part of Stanford University to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement and applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, only individuals who have authority delegated by an appropriate University official may enter into agreements on behalf of the University. See Administrative Guide Memo 5.1.1 Procurement Policies.\nb. Environmental Health & Safety, including Workplace Health and Safety\nMembers of the University Community must be committed to protecting the health and safety of its members by providing safe workplaces. The University will provide information and training about health and safety hazards, and safeguards. University Community members must adhere to good health and safety practices and comply with all environmental health and safety laws and regulations. See Stanford Health and Safety Training Policies.\nc. Non-University Professional Standards\nSome professions and disciplines represented at the University are governed by standards and codes specific to their profession (such as attorneys, certified public accountants, and medical doctors). Those professional standards generally advance the quality of the profession and/or discipline by developing codes of ethics, conduct, and professional responsibility and standards to guide their members. Those belonging to such organizations are expected to adhere to University policies and codes of conduct in addition to any professional standards. If a University Community member believes there is a conflict between a professional standard and University policy, they should contact the Office of the General Counsel.\nd. Academic Policies\nSee Academic Policies and Statements on the Stanford Bulletin website for academic policies.\n5. Confidentiality, Privacy and Information Security\nUniversity Community members receive and generate various types of confidential, regulated, proprietary and private information on behalf of the University. All members of the Community are expected to comply with all applicable rules, laws, and regulations (whether federal, state, local or foreign), contractual obligations, and University policies pertaining to the use, protection and disclosure of this information. When disaffiliating from Stanford, University Community members must return all sensitive University data unless an exception has been granted.\nFind office websites and supporting policies at the following locations:\nPrivacy Office\nInformation Security Office\nPolicy on Privacy and Access to Electronic Information\nPolicy on Information Security\nPolicy on Information Security Incident Response\nPolicy on Privacy and Security of Health Information (HIPAA)\nPolicy on Computer and Network Usage\nUniversity Policies and Statements (for Students)\n6. Financial Responsibilities and Internal Controls\nMembers of the University Community are expected to employ sound business practices and exercise prudent financial management in their stewardship of University resources. Refer to Section 3 of the Administrative Guide for responsibilities related to protection and management of University financial assets.\nPolicies on Financial Administration\n7. Use of University Resources\nUniversity resources must be reserved for business purposes on behalf of the University. They may not be used for personal gain, and may not be used for personal use except in a manner that is incidental, and reasonable in light of the employee's duties. University resources include, but are not limited to:\nUniversity systems (e.g., telephone systems, data communication and networking services),\nThe Stanford domain for electronic communication forums,\nStanford name, logo, and letterhead,\nUniversity equipment (e.g., computers and peripherals, University vehicles),\nStanford facilities,\nProcurement tools such as purchasing cards, travel cards and petty cash,\nUniversity records including student, employee, donor, sponsor, and patient records, and\nThe time and effort of staff, students and others at Stanford.\nPlease see the following policies for more information:\nPolicy on Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities\nPolicy on Unrelated Business Activity\nPolicy on Ownership and Use of Stanford Trademarks and Images\n8. Conflict of Commitment/Conflict of Interest\nUniversity Community members who are Stanford faculty and staff owe their primary professional allegiance to the University and its mission to engage in the highest level of education, research, health care and business practices.\nA conflict of commitment can arise when a person\u2019s external activities, e.g., consulting agreements, speaking engagements, public service, personal business, etc. interfere with the person\u2019s responsibilities to the university. A conflict of commitment usually involves issues of time allocation.\nOutside professional activities, private financial interests or the receipt of benefits or gifts from third parties can cause an actual or perceived conflict of interest.\nRelationships between Stanford and its vendors or sponsors must be free of any real or perceived impropriety or favoritism. University Community members should not solicit any gift, and should not personally accept any material gift, gratuity or payment, in cash or in kind, from any third party seeking to do business with the University or currently doing business with the University.\nIn order to protect our primary mission, University Community members with other professional or financial interests shall disclose them in compliance with applicable conflict of commitment/conflict of interest policies and, if permitted, manage them in compliance with all controls put in place. The policies are available on the following websites:\nFaculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest\nStaff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest\nConflict of Commitment and Interest for Academic Staff and Other Teaching Staff\nPolicy on Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities\nPolicy on Unrelated Business Activity\nPolicy on Ownership and Use of Stanford Trademarks and Images\n9. Response to Governmental or Other Investigations\nStanford University is committed to cooperating with government investigators as required by law. If an employee receives a subpoena, search warrant or other similar document, before taking any action, the employee must immediately contact the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Office of the General Counsel. The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for authorizing the release or copying of any University records or documents.\nIf a government investigator, agent, or auditor comes to the University, an employee should contact their supervisor and the appropriate University office before discussing University business with such investigator, agent, or auditor. If the appropriate office is unknown, the supervisor should contact the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Office of the General Counsel.\n10. Reporting Suspected Violations\nAdherence to this Code also requires that any suspected violations of applicable standards, policies, laws or regulations be brought to the attention of the appropriate cognizant office. Raising such concerns is a service to the University and does not jeopardize the University Community member\u2019s position or employment.\na. Reporting to Management\nMembers of the University Community should report suspected violations of applicable laws, regulations, government contract and grant requirements or this Code and University policies and procedures. This reporting should normally be made initially through standard management channels, beginning with the immediate supervisor, instructor or advisor. If for any reason it is not appropriate to report suspected violations to the immediate supervisor (e.g., the suspected violation is by the supervisor), or the employee is uncomfortable doing so, individuals may go to a higher level of management within their school or department.\nb. Other Reporting\nIf for any reason it is not appropriate to report suspected violations through management channels within the school or departments, or the employee is uncomfortable doing so, individuals may go to:\nHuman Resources,\nThe Office of the Chief Risk Officer,\nThe Office of the General Counsel, \nThe Office for Institutional Equity and Access,\nThe Ethics and Compliance Helpline at: \nPhone: 650-721-2667,\nEmail: integrity@stanford.edu\nWeb Form (anonymous): helpline.stanford.edu \nEvery concern is treated seriously and reviewed in the appropriate manner.\nc. Confidentiality\nConcerns may be reported confidentially, and even anonymously, although the more information given, the easier it is to investigate the concerns. The only anonymous reporting mechanism at the University is the Compliance and Ethics Helpline web form: helpline.stanford.edu.\nd. Cooperation\nAll members of the University Community are expected to cooperate fully in the investigation of potential violations of University policy and applicable rules, laws, or regulations.\ne. Non-Retaliation\nStanford policy prohibits retaliation against an individual who in good faith reports or provides information about concerns or suspected violations. Retaliation is an adverse action taken because an individual has made a report or has participated in an investigation. An adverse action is any action that materially affects that individual's standing or terms and conditions of employment. False accusations made with the intent of harming or retaliating against another person may subject the accuser to disciplinary action. \nf. Consequences of Violation\nConfirmed violations will result in appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the University. In some circumstances, civil or criminal charges and penalties may apply."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/stanford-travel-card-tcard", "text": "Stanford Travel Card (TCard)\nIt is the responsibility of the cardholder incurring expenses, individuals who assist others with incurring expenses and others involved in the preparation and approval of financial transactions to exercise good stewardship of university funds and to adhere to university policies. See detailed roles and responsibilities on the Stanford Travel Card (TCard) Overview.\nPersonal Charges\nThe Travel Card may not be used for personal expenses, except for incidental expenses that cannot be easily separated from a business charge, such as charges for in-room movies on a hotel bill. When personal charges are incurred on the TCard in these exceptional cases, such charges must be paid directly by the cardholder to Stanford, and an expense report must be processed. A separate, wholly personal charge on a TCard is not allowed. Travelers should neither gain nor lose personal funds as a result of business travel on behalf of Stanford University.\nThe cardholder is personally responsible for repaying Stanford University for any non-reimbursable TCard charges after completion of travel. For details on how to pay back Stanford for Travel Card personal purchases, refer to How to: Return Personal Expenses Charged to Travel Card.\nRepeated personal, non-reimbursable purchases will be considered a misuse of the TCard and may result in card suspension or having Stanford University cardholder privileges revoked. Misuse of the TCard may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\nSpending Limits\nDuring the online application process, the monthly spending limit for the card is established by the department and approved by the financial approver for the associated account(s) (PTAs) and by the Card Services team. Changes to spending limits can be requested by submitting a limit change request through the Credit Card Profiles Change Request tool or by submitting a Support Request.\nMerchant Restrictions\nThe Travel Card is set up for use with merchants selling travel-related goods and services, such as travel agents, transportation and lodging providers and restaurants. Refer to the university's preferred travel providers, Stanford Travel, for more information.\nCompliance With Expenditure Policies\nTravel Card expenditures must comply with, but are not limited to, the following:\nExpenditures must be reasonable and necessary. Costs for daily meals, daily lodging, transportation and other incidentals must comply with university policy.\nAirline tickets must comply with the Class of Fare policy described on the Airfare Policy page. Refer to Administrative Guide Policy 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses for more information.\nTravel Card transactions subject to California sales and use tax where tax was not charged at the point of sale may be assessed the tax by Payment Services and Business Expense.\nFor additional guidance, refer to Business and Travel Expense Policies.\nCompliance With Sponsored Project Policies\nCardholders who are allocating expenses to a sponsored project account must be in compliance with their respective sponsoring agency\u2019s policies. For example, TCard expenditures allocated to a sponsored project account must comply with the following:\nGovernment Unallowable Allocations must be clearly identified in the expense report in Expense Requests. Government Unallowable purchases cannot be allocated into a sponsored-project account.\nUS Flagship Carrier Use. When federal funds are used for foreign travel, tickets must be purchased in compliance with the Fly America Act. This act stipulates that tickets must be purchased for travel on either (i) a U.S. flag air carrier or (ii) a foreign carrier that operates under a U.S. flag air carrier code-sharing agreement and identifies the U.S. flag air carrier's designator code and flight number. Refer to Federal Air Carrier Requirement (Fly America Act) for details and exceptions.\nCardholders allocating their expenses to a sponsored project account should direct questions regarding allowability to the fund specialists assigned to their department.\nTimeline for Transaction Processing\nTravel Card verifiers process Travel Card Transactions through the Expense Requests system. Processing transactions in a timely manner is important to ensure expenditures are correctly reported. Expense reports should be completed and submitted within 10 days and no later than 60 days after the completion of travel. TCard charges appear in Expense Requests within one to five business days of the transaction date.\nFailure to complete verification and approvals within 60 days of the completion of travel may result in card suspension and/or expenditures reported as taxable income to the card user or the cardholder. Cardholders may verify their own transactions but must route transactions to an approver set up in the Authority Manager system who has authority over the account charged, does not report directly or indirectly to the cardholder, and is not the beneficiary of the transaction. A detailed description of all responsibilities is available on the Stanford Travel Card Program page.\nIf a TCard transaction is outstanding more than 60 days past the expense end date (if indicated) or post date, the transaction will be force cleared by Financial Management Services to the guarantee PTA. The department is responsible for moving that cleared transaction via the iJournals system to the appropriate PTA and expenditure type.\nEffective with the first force clearing of 2024, an individual\u2019s PCard or TCard may be suspended if a transaction is force cleared by FMS in any two quarters within a 12 month period. View the quarterly deadlines on the Clearing of Aging Transactions Policy page. Learn more about TCard suspension on the Travel Card Program page.\nIf an individual PCard\u2019s or TCard\u2019s transactions are force cleared by FMS:\nThe first quarter that this happens, the card custodian/cardholder, their manager, and the finance contact in their school or budget unit will receive a warning notification from the Card Services team via email.\nIf FMS force clears transactions on the same card in another quarter within a rolling 12 month period, the card custodian/cardholder, their manager, and the finance contact in their school or budget unit will receive a suspension notification from the Card Services team via email. The card may be suspended 10 business days after the notification is sent. The card suspension period is 60 days, and reactivation after a suspension for force cleared transactions must be requested and approved. For questions about this process, submit a support request to the Card Services team.\nIf FMS force clears transactions on the same card for a third quarter within a rolling 12 month period, the card may be revoked.\nWarnings and suspensions are tracked by credit card, not by cardholder.\nWhen transactions are force cleared, departments lose the opportunity to assign a business purpose and attach receipts to the transaction in the Expense Request System, and therefore must store receipts (or explanations for the lack of receipts) locally and ensure they are readily available in case of an audit. To learn more about force clearing, visit Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions.\nDisputing Travel Card Charges\nCardholders or the assigned verifier are responsible for promptly disputing any unidentified charges with the merchant first and should try to resolve the dispute. However, if it cannot be resolved with the merchant, only the cardholder can dispute the transaction with JPMorgan Chase, which must occur within 45 days of the posting date of the transaction.\nSince many merchants use centralized clearing houses for credit card processing, the name and location of the merchant on the statement may not initially be recognized by the cardholder. Before disputing any charges, the cardholder should check expenditure records carefully and/or work with the traveler to make certain that the charge is indeed an error.\nDisputed charges must be resolved with the bank no later than 60 days from the date the transaction was posted. The Department is ultimately liable for any fraudulent and erroneous charges not resolved directly with the merchant. See: How to Record Disputed Travel Card (TCard) Transactions.\nCardholder Misuse\nUsing the Travel Card for purchases that do not comply with Stanford\u2019s Travel Card policy and other university policies and procedures is defined as cardholder misuse.\nThe consequences of cardholder misuse may include card suspension (including suspension of a Purchasing Card, if the employee has one), card cancellation, disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the university, and any other potential action identified following a university investigation.\nCardholder Fraud\nCardholder fraud is defined as intentionally using a Travel Card for financial or personal gain. This is not the same as fraud committed by a third party; for more information about how cardholders can protect a TCard from third-party fraud, see the Travel Card Program page.\nThe consequences of cardholder fraud may include card suspension (including suspension of a Purchasing Card, if the employee has one), card cancellation, disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the university, and any other potential action identified following a university investigation.\nAudit and Misuse Investigation\nAs described in Administrative Guide Memo 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities, departments must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline of suspected financial irregularities. Individuals wishing to report suspected incidents anonymously may contact the Ethics and Compliance helpline.\nWhen warranted by information obtained during preliminary research, the Office of the Chief Risk Officer will commence a fact-finding investigation into the suspected financial irregularity. The Office of the Chief Risk Officer will plan and coordinate the investigation and will consult with the Office of the General Counsel as appropriate.\nAudit investigations may identify cardholder misuse or fraud, and result in card suspension (including suspension of a Purchasing Card, if the employee has one), card cancellation, disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the university, and any other potential action identified following a university investigation."}

It covers general policies for the purchase of major and minor construction, equipment, supplies and services by Stanford. The policies in this chapter do not apply to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).\n1. Authority to Commit University Funds\nThe Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, which has responsibility for all University funds, including those received under grants and contracts and those originating with other outside sources, has delegated authority for the acquisition and disposition of property and the expenditure of University monies to various University officers and officials (see Guide Memo 3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures).\na. Department Administrators\nDepartment administrators in Schools and Departments have the authority to approve the commitment and expenditure of funds for a given purpose and against specific accounts for which they have been officially delegated authority (see Guide Memo 3.2.1: Authorizing Expenditures). For the purposes of this Guide Memo, this action usually takes the form of a Purchase Requisition.\nb. Procurement\nProcurement, part of Stanford's Financial Management Services organization, is authorized to execute contracts and place orders for goods and services, subject to the receipt of an approved Purchase Requisition (see [1.a.] above). With the exception of certain delegations, Procurement is the sole holder of this authority at the University.\nc. Purchases by University Departments\nProcurement has delegated authority to departments to approve the acquisition of goods or services when the total dollar value of the transaction is less than $25,000 per transaction and does not require a contract or is less than $5,000 on a Purchasing Card transaction. (See Guide Memo 5.3.3: Purchasing Cards.)\nd. Unauthorized Purchases\nNo person not authorized in writing by Stanford may commit Stanford funds to purchase goods or services. If an unauthorized person attempts to commit University funds, Stanford may consider the acquisition effort null and void and decline to pay any invoice that might be issued. Stanford officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Procurement Officer, and those to whom the Chief Procurement Officer has delegated authority, including operations managers, supervisors and buyers, may refuse to ratify such transactions. In such a case, the supplier may look to the individual placing the order for payment or reimbursement.\nPurchases made without an approved Oracle purchase order number will be flagged and Procurement will contact the requestor for review. Further non-compliance will result in written notice to requester, approver, and the appropriate school or department financial manager. A third instance of non-compliance will result in written notice to the Head of the Administrative Department or the Senior Associate Dean of Finance and Academic Dean of the School, and may result in suspension of Oracle privileges and Purchasing Card use.\ne. Personal Expenses\nPersonal expenses and purchases that are not made on behalf of the University or for use by the University are not permitted. These may be considered fraudulent transactions. Purchases must be for the use and benefit of Stanford University, regardless of intent to reimburse Stanford. If any Stanford user associated with the purchase commits purposeful fraudulent or other inappropriate behavior regarding the proper use of the requisitioning and purchasing process, it will be considered serious misconduct and will result in disciplinary action.\n2. Competition\nThe University's policy is that acquisition of products or services will be by competition between potential suppliers, to the maximum practical extent subject to the requirements of quality, price and performance. Attestation of price reasonableness should be acquired prior to submitting any requisition for approval. This is the responsibility of the requestor. Therefore, individuals that request goods and services are responsible for attaining and documenting their efforts related to purchases requests. Requestors may elect to do one or more of the following to ensure and/or document price reasonableness:\nSolicit competitive bids\nCompare pricing across suppliers\nDocument justification for a single source or sole source (a single source is a supplier specifically selected amongst others, due to superior compatibility, quality, service, support, continuity, etc.; a sole source supplies a product or service for which there is no alternative supplier). The source justification should include the following information: \nA specific description of the supplies or services required to meet the needs, and a statement of facts that show the unique qualifications of the services or items selected to satisfy those needs.\nA description of efforts made to locate other sources of supply.\nDocumentation that the anticipated cost is fair and reasonable. This can be a comparison of prices when the item is generally available or, when the item is to be specially fabricated, an analysis of the manufacturer's cost.\nAny other information supporting the use of other than full and open competition.\n3. Conflict of Interest or Ethics\na. Policies\nAll procurement activities must conform to the University Code of Conduct (Guide Memo 1.1.1), Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest (Guide Memo 1.5.2), and Faculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest (Research Policy Handbook 4.1). Any known or apparent violation of these policies, whether by an employee or a supplier, must be immediately reported as directed in these policies.\nb. Personal Purchases\nProcurement does not arrange personal purchases for Stanford faculty, staff or students. The Buyer can render assistance to such individuals only by informing callers of the names of known suppliers. The buyer will spend no time locating suppliers or securing quotations. Similarly, a department may not place an order for an individual employee or student and then have that person reimburse the department.\n4. On-Campus Sources of Goods and Services\nStanford provides many goods and services on campus for less than an individual order placed off-campus would cost. A department needing a product or service provided by a Stanford source should order from a Stanford organization that provides it. If Procurement receives a requisition from a department for an item available at Stanford, the buyer may forward the requisition to the appropriate Stanford organization or require the department to place an order that can be processed without the assistance of a buyer.\n5. Purchases on Government Grants and Contracts\nStanford University receives many government grants and contracts for academic research. In carrying out its sponsored projects, Stanford fulfills the agreement's conditions, some of which are stated in the sponsored project agreement, others in statutes, regulations and policy statements.\na. Terms and Conditions\nA grant or contract often requires Stanford to include certain contractual clauses in purchase orders or subcontracts issued under the award. Procurement determines which contractual clauses are appropriate for inclusion in individual contracts. Purchase orders should be placed through the Procurement department to ensure compliance with Stanford's purchasing policies and legal requirements.\nb. Prior Approval\nIf a government sponsored project agreement is a funding source, a government representative may be required to approve a proposed purchase of capital equipment or complex goods or services before the buyer places the order. See the Property Administration Manual for prior approval procedures.\n(1) Offices Needing Documentation\nThe requesting department is responsible for maintaining records of approval documentation. When required, Purchasing or Accounts Payable may request copies of such documents.\n(2) Subcontracts\nIf the purchase requires government approval of subcontract provisions, the buyer will obtain necessary approval and keep it in the Procurement Office files.\nc. Pre-Acquisition Screening\nThe U.S. Government Office of Management and Budget Circular A-110 and other government regulations that cover the administration of agreements with federal government agencies require that Stanford screen the existing inventory of capital equipment for availability before ordering capital equipment to avoid purchasing \"unnecessary or duplicative items.\"\n(1) Screening Levels\nThe department making the purchase must screen for items of equipment costing between $5,000 and $24,999 at the departmental level before purchase, and items at $25,000 and above at the University level. Equipment costing less than $5,000 need not be screened.\n(2) Loans and Transfers\nGovernment policy encourages loans or transfers of equipment from other government projects.\n(3) Where to Get Help\nFor information on screening procedures, see the Property Administration Manual.\n6. Government-Required Licenses and Permits\nCertain transactions require permits or licenses from the federal government. Stanford's customs broker and preferred vendor for outside logistics services provide consultation and assistance as necessary. Procurement will provide contact information for current vendors on request. The permits or licenses most frequently required to transact business are:\na. Agriculture Permits\nThe Department of Agriculture issues permits for import of certain organisms and biological vectors. The requesting department is responsible for obtaining a permit for each shipment or group of related shipments. The form required by the USDA is VS 16-3.\nb. Import or Export Licenses\nThe Department of Commerce or the U.S. Department of State issues licenses for either export or the importation of equipment or technical data. The requesting department is responsible for obtaining and/or signing the required license.\nc. Duty Free Entry of Scientific Equipment\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce may exempt payment of import duties for scientific equipment. Each department requesting such exemption is responsible for filling out the appropriate paperwork. The form required is ITA-338P.\nd. Radioactive Materials\nA requisition for radioactive materials must contain a Controlled Radiation Authorization (CRA) number (obtainable from Health Physics) before Purchasing processes the order.\n7. Shipping of Biological and Hazardous Materials\nThe United States Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration enforce strict and detailed regulations to assure the safety of aircraft and other modes of transportation for hazardous materials or \"Dangerous Goods.\" Dangerous Goods include, but are not limited to those that are flammable, combustible, corrosive, reactive, oxidizing, toxic, radioactive, infectious, elevated in temperature, highly magnetic, or compressed gasses. Aerosol cans and Dry Ice are also regulated. Violations may result in monetary penalties.\na. Training\nThe person(s) packing the material and/or signing the shipping papers must be trained and certified in the shipping of Dangerous Goods. The training and certification must be repeated within every two year period.\nb. Where to Get Help\nThe Environmental, Health and Safety Department offers training and has a certified shipper on staff. EH&S personnel are available and ready to help prepare any Dangerous Good for shipment. For web-based information, see Shipping of Hazardous Materials."}

Temporary Help Agencies\nIf the individual's compensation for work performed at the University is paid by a temporary help agency, the person is employed by the agency, and is not put on the University payroll. The University pays the agency, which is then responsible for tax deductions, Social Security payments, and Worker's Compensation insurance.\na. Approved Agencies\nProcurement seeks competitive bids every two years from temporary help agencies, and enters into contracts with selected agencies, which are placed on an approved list. Only agencies on the approved list should be used.\n5. Payments to Foreign Visitors\nFor detailed information, see Inviting and Paying Foreign Visitors.\na. Visa Requirements\nAll offers of reimbursements, travel payments or honoraria to foreign visitors are contingent on the visitor entering the United States on a visa that allows the visitor to receive payments (see Guide Memo 2.4.1: Visas for and Employment of Foreign Nationals.\n(1) Honoraria\nVisitors with J-1 visa status may be paid honoraria but visitors with non-Stanford sponsored visas must have written permission from their sponsoring officer for payment. Visitors with B-1, B-2, WB or WT status may be paid honoraria if:\nThe event lasts no more than nine days, and\nServices are a direct benefit to Stanford, and\nThe visitor has not received payment from more than five institutions in the past six months.\n(2) Travel Expenses\nVisitors from countries that have agreements with the U.S. to waive visitor visas (WB and WT) and visitors with J-1, H-1, B-1 or B-2, or A-1/A-2 visa status may be reimbursed for business travel expenses.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/administrative-guide-policy-1261-foreign-currency-hedging", "text": "11.6.1 Foreign Currency Hedging | Administrative Guide\nSkip to main content Skip to secondary navigation \nAuthority\nApproved by the Vice President for Business Affairs & Chief Financial Officer.\nLast Updated\nApril 01, 2014 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 3.1.6; 34.7\nThis Guide Memo describes the requirements and considerations associated with entering into foreign currency hedging contracts to hedge operational exposures. This Guide Memo is not applicable to the Stanford Management Company.\n1. Fundamentals of Currency Hedging\nAs a global University, Stanford faces foreign currency risk from its international business activities. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact departmental budgets and the cash flows of its overseas operations. The University hedges currency risk exclusively for the purpose of reducing or eliminating volatility in departmental budgets and related cash flows. Currency hedges must be related to business transactions with a high level of certainty where the foreign currency amounts and payment dates are known. Projected receipts and disbursements related to transactions may be hedged by two types of instruments: Spot Contracts and Forward Contracts.\nForeign Currency Spot Contract: An agreement with a financial institution to buy one currency and sell another at the current market exchange rate. Spot transactions require an upfront cash payment and settle within two business days.\nForeign Currency Forward Contract: An agreement with a financial institution to buy or sell a currency at a set exchange rate at a specific date in the future. The forward rate is equivalent to the spot rate plus a premium or discount equal to the net present value of the interest rate differential between the two currencies. Cash payment is required when the contract matures.\nThe University does not use Option Contracts for currency hedging at this time.\nThe objectives of currency hedging at the University are to:\nReduce or eliminate volatility in the U.S. Dollar value of University's cash and cash flows, and\nSupport business activities that are denominated in foreign currencies.\nCurrency hedges may be used to protect the U.S. Dollar (USD) value of both foreign currency denominated receipts and payments. Spot transactions, such as routine foreign currency vendor payments that are currently due, are processed through Disbursements. The Treasurer's Office is responsible for foreign currency when it needs to be held for an extended period, a foreign currency denominated receipt in excess of $25,000 is expected, or when a future transaction denominated in foreign currency needs to be hedged.\n2. Hedging Considerations\nBefore requesting a currency hedge, one must evaluate the stability of the business transaction associated with the hedge and the potential impact of currency fluctuations on the budget. The department requiring the hedge bears the currency fluctuation risk if a contract is entered into to lock in an exchange rate for a vendor payment, and that payment is cancelled. Thus, the underlying transaction must be committed before requesting a hedge. If future cash flows, or timing of cash flows are uncertain, the risk can be mitigated by hedging a fraction of the exposure or by spreading contract maturities over multiple time periods. The currency hedging department is responsible for gains and losses associated with adjustments made to currency hedges. Departments are advised to include loss offset provisions in contracts priced in foreign currency, to pass through the financial risk associated with adjustments or cancellations.\nAccounting treatment for the currency hedge should also be taken into consideration. The U.S. Dollar value of the currency held in a spot contract is subject to revaluation before the payment is completed. Individual departments' income statements will reflect the change in value of foreign currency held at fiscal year end and, the University will revalue its overall exposure at each month end.\n3. Setting the Maturity Date of a Currency Hedge\nIf foreign currency is needed on a specific date, the currency hedge is set to mature on this exact date and instructions can be provided in advance to the financial institution to deliver the foreign currency payment to the vendor on the maturity date. If the payment date is not defined, such as a payment date linked to a milestone, the currency hedge maturity is set on the earliest possible date that the funds will be needed. In that instance, foreign currency is held in a multi-currency account after the hedge matures until the vendor payment is completed. The Treasurer's Office must receive instructions to transfer payment at least five business days before payment is due. Departments requesting a spot currency purchase are required to fund the transaction when the purchase is completed.\n4. Approval Process\nThe Treasurer's Office can provide market quotes, modeling, and help clarify the hedging process. A request to enter into a currency hedge must be submitted to the Treasurer's Office and executed by a party with the appropriate spending authority. The currency hedge request form includes:\nAmount of foreign currency to be hedged\nCurrency to be hedged\nDirection of the hedge (sending or receiving currency)\nDate that the foreign currency is needed\nBusiness purpose of the currency hedge\nParties in the underlying business transaction (department and external party)\nDepartmental contact making request\nPTA to which the currency hedge should be booked\nCopies of executed contracts for the related business transaction, if applicable, and proof of spending authority or a delegation of authority for the requester should be included with the request. Foreign currency hedging requests are approved after a review of the related business transaction and receipt of all completed documentation. The Office of the Treasurer should be consulted for proposed hedges related to government-sponsored research as complex rules apply. Contact the Treasurer's Office by submitting a service request, or visit the Office of the Treasurer's website for more information. \n5. Responsibilities of Departments and Treasurer's Office\nAny material changes to the underlying business activity being hedged should be reported to the Treasurer's Office promptly.\nRequests to modify or cancel a hedge should be submitted in writing to the Treasurer's Office as soon as the change in the related business transaction is confirmed.

Expense Allocation Policies\nAn expense allocation is a method that enables apportionment of a particular expense or expenses to Projects-Tasks-Awards (PTAs) that specifically benefit from those charges. Allocations are used in situations where it is difficult to determine in advance how much to charge each PTA for a shared supply or service. They are used to distribute expenses to PTAs receiving the benefit of the good or service. Allocations are often used to distribute costs from expenditure allocation PTAs (formerly knows as \"clearing accounts\") or service centers. They may also be used to distribute costs between benefiting PTAs when a purchase was originally charged to one PTA and one or more other PTAs also benefited from the purchase. Allocations are also used to distribute charges from independent systems (known as \"feeders\") into the financial system. Often allocations are repetitive or are required on a regular basis.\na. Expenditure Allocation PTA Definition\nAn expenditure allocation PTA, as described in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTAs) is a special PTA in which charges for materials, supplies, services, or salaries are accumulated, and then allocated each month to PTAs receiving the benefit of the good or service. Salary and material costs cannot be combined in the same expenditure allocation PTA. If salary and material expenses must be combined, a service center must be used. Sponsored project PTAs may not be used as expenditure allocation PTAs.\nb. Allocation Basis\nThe basis of allocation/distribution (e.g., effort, square footage, headcount) must logically relate to the type of costs being allocated. It must produce an allocation to each activity/account in reasonable proportion to the benefits received. The allocation methodology must produce a result that is allowable, allocable, reasonable and consistent. Feeder systems typically charge other departments based on usage or services provided at specified rates. Administrative expenses may not be distributed or rotated among sponsored agreements. Departments shall not use any type of pooled allocation method to charge expenses to federal sponsored agreements except from a service center with approved rates, or as described in the Research Policy Handbook. For more information, see Research Administration Policy and Compliance.\nc. Documentation\nOnline expense allocation documentation must clearly show the nature of the cost being allocated. The originator of the journal must include comments about the distribution basis in the online documentation and retain documentation of the allocation methodology and calculation results in accordance with the government and University's record retention requirements. Feeder systems track the charges and maintain documentation in their own systems.\nd. Approvals\nBefore an allocation journal or feeder is submitted to the financial system, the department processing the journal/feeder must have received approval from an authorized individual for each PTA charged. Certain feeder transactions, such as utility charges, are approved implicitly as part of the annual budget process. Approval for other allocations and feeders can be a \"blanket\" approval for regular ongoing costs allocated in a consistent manner. Approval can be evidenced in writing in a memo, on a request form (e.g., SU-13 or similar form) or via electronic means. The department originating the journal/feeder must maintain documentation of written approval. For allocation journals, written approval must be on file from individuals with signature authority over the PTAs being charged, while online approval is required for the PTA or Project-Fund-Object being credited. The originator of the journal attests to the following when creating the allocation journal:\nThis allocation is being processed in accordance with policy\nThe cost is an appropriate charge to the PTAs sharing the expense\nThe PTA actually benefited from the cost of the goods and services\nThe transaction is documented according to policy\nFeeder transactions are not routed for online approval, nor does the originator make the above attestation in the financial system. The ability to act as a feeder into the financial system is granted by the Controller's Office with the understanding that the transactions follow University policy. Feeder business process owners must sign an annual attestation that they understand and accept their responsibilities and have followed the policies. For information on university policy for iJournal expense transfers, refer to Administrative Guide Policy 3.2.2: Cost Transfers.\ne. Deadlines\nAllocation journals should be prepared and submitted before the end of the month following the month the expense was posted.Example: A cost that appears on an expenditure allocation PTA's March expenditure or operating statement should be allocated to the PTAs that benefited from the service by the last working day in April. Allocations submitted after the deadlines must include a valid reason for the delay.\n2. Salary Distribution Offset Policies\nThe federal government and some nongovernment sponsors require that the University charge salaries and wages to sponsored projects as they are earned. However, many faculty members who are on 9-, 10-, or 11-month appointments choose to have a reduced salary amount paid over all 12 months of the year. To correctly charge sponsored project PTAs or the related cost sharing PTAs in such situations, departments may use the Labor Distribution Schedule method or the Salary Distribution Offset method. The Labor Distribution Schedule method is preferred, as it requires fewer accounting transactions to accomplish the result. In the employee's Oracle Labor Distribution Schedule sponsored or cost sharing PTAs are charged the appropriate percentage of the faculty member's 9-month salary (subject to any regulatory caps) for the academic period. The remainder of the amount to be PAID over 12 months is charged to an operating budget or other unrestricted PTA. For templates to aid in the calculation, see Faculty Labor Distribution Entry Templates. When following the Salary Distribution Offset (using after-the-fact Labor Distribution Adjustments for salary expenses originally incurred after March 31, 2005, or Salary Journals for salary expenses originally incurred before April 1, 2005) method the department must:\nCharge the faculty member's entire salary to the operating budget PTA paying for the non-research portion of salary. (For more information on payroll processing see Guide Memo 2.2.3: University Payroll, and Faculty Specific Payroll Administration. \nRecord a transfer to allocate the amount of earned salary to the sponsored project(s).The salary actually paid will show as a charge on the expenditure detail report for the operating budget PTA. The salary earned will show as a charge on the sponsored project expenditure detail report and as a credit on the operating budget expenditure detail report.\na. Approvals\nOnline signature of the person responsible for the PTA to be debited is required. Signature for the PTA to be credited is not required.\nb. Deadlines\nSalary Distribution Offset transfers should be prepared and submitted in the month the salary is earned.Example: Salary earned during April should be recorded during April.A Salary Distribution Offset transfer submitted after the deadline must include a valid reason for the delay.\n3. Allocation and Offset Procedures\na. Getting Started\nAllocations and offsets, including feeders, are submitted using iJournals or Labor Distribution Adjustments in the University's online financial system. Guidance on using the University's online accounting system, including procedures for using Allocation and Salary Journals, Uploads, Templates, and Labor Distribution Adjustments, is available from the Month-End/Year-End Close section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nb. Nonsalary Charges\nAllocations from expenditure allocation PTAs, service centers or other PTAs may be made by the following methods:\nAllocation Journals are used for submitting a new allocation, a transaction containing repetitive transfers where charges have been previously authorized. Journal transactions entered using this form are limited to non-salary/student-aid expenditure types.\nAllocation Templates may be set up to save time in processing repetitive allocations each month.\nUpload Allocation and Feeder Journals may be used to upload an allocation created in another system.\nc. Salary Charges\nAllocations from expenditure allocation PTAs or offsets are made by using a Labor Distribution Adjustment or a Salary Journal. See Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, for further guidance.\nd. Authorization Requirements\nAll users of university\u2019s financial systems must have an active SUNet ID and password. Financial transaction preparers and approvers must be granted appropriate authority privileges using the Authority Manager system and complete required training. For more information, see Authority to Create Financial Transactions and Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford\u2019s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\ne. Review\nTo ensure compliance with this Guide Memo, the Office of Sponsored Research will periodically sample and review the supporting documentation. Originators may contact the Office of Sponsored Research for further guidance, see the DoResearch website."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/responsible-purchasing", "text": "Responsible Purchasing\nTo support responsible purchasing at the university, Stanford Procurement Services provides guidance by purchasing category:\nTravel\nFor many individuals, emissions from travel comprise the largest portion of their personal carbon footprint. At Stanford, emissions from collective student, faculty, staff and visitor travel equate to more than four times the university\u2019s direct emissions from fuel burned on campus. Individuals traveling on university business have several options to reduce their travel footprint. For example, individuals can consider attending conferences and events virtually if there is not a need to be there in person, select the lowest emissions option if the airline or Stanford Travel booking channel displays carbon estimates in flight searches, take the most direct route when flying (nonstop flight), and utilize public transportation when traveling on behalf of Stanford. The Sustainable Stanford website provides more tips on reducing your travel footprint. \nPaper\nAll purchases of paper products, including both office and janitorial, should either be made from 100 percent recycled content or be Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified. Products made from recycled paper not only prevent trees from being cut down, but also require up to 30 percent less energy and 50 percent less water to produce than non-recycled paper.\nOffice and Break Room Supplies\nMany office products (e.g., binders, pens, staplers, etc.) are disposed of before reaching the end of their useful life. Therefore, Stanford personnel should first check to see if the need can be fulfilled with reused items. Consider checking the Reuse website or posting to email lists to find the office supplies you need before buying new ones.\nBecause office supplies are highly consumable, the most important sustainability aspect is keeping used materials out of the landfill, through the purchase of products that are recyclable or compostable and made with recycled content.\nBreak room supplies include service ware, such as cups, plates and utensils, accounting for a high level of waste and negative impact to the environment. Reusable service ware is the most responsible purchasing option. If disposable service ware is required, BPA certified compostable items should be purchased. Compostable items turn into soil in 45 days at a commercial composting facility.\nLab Supplies\nReusable options for lab consumables, such as pipette tips and boxes, gloves, media bottles, etc. are becoming more available and are often less expensive. For example, instead of purchasing new pipette tip boxes every time, one can reuse the boxes and purchase refillable tip racks, which are up to 70 percent cheaper. The Cardinal Green Labs program hosts a lab share event every fall and spring to facilitate reuse between labs. For supplies that cannot be reused, labs should purchase recyclable options where available and arrange for used items to be dropped off for recycling at key locations on campus.\nChemicals\nBefore purchasing new chemicals, purchasers should check with Stanford's Surplus Chemical Inventory. Through this program, Environmental Health and Safety (EH and S) delivers free chemicals to labs within 24 hours. Purchasers and lab managers are encouraged to use Stanford\u2019s Chemical Inventory Management and Tracking System, ChemTracker, which ensures good inventory management practices and can lead to cost savings from avoiding duplicate purchases.\nElectronic Equipment\nPurchases of electronic equipment should be EPEAT certified. EPEAT is the most comprehensive sustainability certification for IT equipment (e.g., computers, monitors, TVs) evaluating a number of different attributes, including materials sourcing, environmental safety during production, energy consumption, and end of life. A laptop computer that is EPEAT certified uses 42 percent less energy, contains 25 percent more recycled content, and contains 89 percent less toxic metals than a non-EPEAT computer. In the past few years, 100 percent of Stanford\u2019s electronics purchased through its major suppliers have been EPEAT certified. EPEAT provides model contract language that can be included in requests for proposals.\nNon-IT equipment purchases should be Energy Star certified. Energy Star is the most robust and prevalent sustainability certification for non-IT equipment. The certification is given to the most energy efficient models in each equipment category. Purchasing Energy Star will ensure that the equipment\u2019s energy consumption and carbon footprint is as low as possible during use.\nFurniture\nAs furniture is often disposed of before reaching the end of its useful life, when purchasing furniture, Stanford personnel should first check the Stanford Reuse website to see if the need can be fulfilled with reused items.\nNew furniture sourced for Stanford should not include toxic chemicals. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, there are over 80,000 chemicals in use today, most are unregulated and only some have undergone sufficient health testing. Many of these toxic chemicals end up in furniture, specifically: Flame retardants, Polyvinyl Chloride, Volatile Organic Compounds, Fluorinated Chemicals, and Antimicrobials. Recent research clearly links these chemicals to adverse health effects including cancer, interference with the hormone system, impairments to neurological development, and reproductive harm. The Consumer Product Safety Commission claims that removing flame retardants and other chemicals does not compromise fire safety."}

Stanford Policy\nStanford University is committed to increasing significantly the opportunities for minority, women and disabled people to engage in business with the University.\na. Purpose\nThis policy statement supports a long-range plan to enhance Stanford's external affirmative action. The plan serves to promote diversity through the judicious use of the University's financial and other resources to increase opportunities for small businesses and businesses owned by targeted concerns to participate in economic opportunities arising from University business activities.\nb. Scope\nThe classes covered by this policy, as defined by the Federal Government, include Asian, Black, Latino/Hispanic and Native American, women of all racial/ethnic background, people who are disabled or physically challenged, veterans, and other targeted concerns.\nc. Implementation\nThe President and Provost will provide the leadership for promulgating this policy; however, responsibility for its implementation rests with individual vice presidents, deans, directors of major institutions and centers, the Chief Executive Officer of the Stanford Management Company, and the heads of other organizations not covered above.\n2. Federal Contracts\nPublic Law 95-507 and Executive Order 12138 encourage organizations that receive contracts from federal agencies to do business with small businesses and other targeted concerns regardless of size. The University's responsibilities under these laws are described in detail in the document \"Utilization of Small Business Concerns, Small Business Concerns Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, and Women-Owned Business Concerns,\" which is published in the Procurement Manual. Specific questions as to applicability to particular situations should be addressed to the Office of Sponsored Research.\na. Definitions\n\"Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities. The social disadvantage of individuals must stem from circumstances beyond their control.\" 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(3)(i)\n\"Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities, as compared to others in the same line of business and competitive market area who are not socially disadvantaged.\" 13 CFR 124.1-1(c)(4)(i)\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) defines the members of these groups. An updated listing can be found online at the U.S. Small Business Administration website. \nSubcontract: \"Any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract.\" Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 80-2.Under this definition, subcontracting means every purchase order and agreement, as well as other expenses such as travel.\nb. Contracts Affected\n(1) Contracts between $25,000 and $499,999\nTerms of government contracts over $25,000 in value require the University to have a program to insure business opportunities for small and minority owned businesses. Stanford's External Affirmative Action Program meets that requirement.\n(2) Contracts $500,000 and over\nFor contracts of $500,000 or more, a specific plan must be made and implemented. A Small Business Liaison Officer (a Stanford-designated University official) oversees the operation of the plan. The University is responsible for establishing percentage goals of subcontracting business (expressed as a proportion of total subcontracting dollars) to be awarded to small and small disadvantaged suppliers. For assistance or information on goals required by specific agencies, contact the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR).\nc. Procedures\n(1) Preparing the Subcontracting Plan\nWhen a request for a subcontracting plan is received from an agency, OSR notifies the cognizant department and Procurement. Procurement and the department meet to review product and service areas with subcontracting opportunities, and based on this review, determine reasonable goals for the plan. Procurement submits data for the plan to OSR. Procurement then writes the subcontracting plan and submits it to the government agency.\n(2) Vendor Search\nDepartments must investigate small and disadvantaged business possibilities prior to submitting a requisition. Departments that wish further searching to be done by Procurement should so specify in the \"Remarks\" screen of the requisition, and should attach documentation of the department's search efforts and their results.\n(3) Reports\nThe federal government requires periodic reports on progress toward the achievement of goals set in a contract's original subcontracting plan. Procurement prepares reports of purchases under each contract, and notifies departments of progress against goals.\n3. Sources of Business Information\na. Directories\nTo help departments, Procurement maintains small business directories and other resources. All the directories are commodity-indexed. Call Procurement for copies and information.\nb. Online Access to Supplier Information\nOnline information about vendor size, ownership status and products offered is available to departments in the Oracle Financials system. Procurement Buyers are also available to assist with sourcing needs.\nc. SBA CCR System\nThe Small Business Administration has developed a computerized, commodity indexed database of small businesses. Call Procurement for more information. Procurement maintains links to this and other resources on the Gateway to Financial Activities website."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/administrative-guide-policy-542-business-and-travel-expenses", "text": "5.4.2 Business and Travel Expenses\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36.7\nThe university pays directly or reimburses individuals for expenses that are necessary and appropriate to conduct University business. This policy outlines the guiding principles, reimbursement and travel policies with examples of business-related expenses at Stanford University. This policy applies to all fund types and business expenses, including travel undertaken for university business and purchases of items to be owned by Stanford. It should be used in conjunction with resources and procedural information on the Fingate website. This policy is based on and in alignment with the expectations set forth by AGM 1.1.1: Code of Conduct, specifically with regard to employing sound business practices and exercising prudent financial management in the stewardship of University resources.\nApplicability:\nThis policy is applicable to direct payments and reimbursements of:\nBusiness meals and entertainment expenses,\nTravel expenses (expenses incurred while traveling on University business)\nPurchases of items to be owned by Stanford (including purchases made by visitors and students)\nAdditional information on purchasing methods can be found in AGM 5.3: Purchasing Goods and Services.\n1. Guiding Principles\na. Supporting University Travelers\nIt is highly encouraged that Stanford travelers use Stanford Travel booking channels when booking flights, hotels, and rental cars for university-sponsored travel. Stanford Travel booking channels automatically register itineraries and any booking updates to the Travel Registry, streamline the reimbursement process, and offer discounts, benefits, and perks to travelers. In addition, the Stanford Travel team can provide specialized assistance as needed to travelers who book through Stanford Travel. This assistance includes advocacy for travelers when unexpected circumstances occur. \nIn most cases, use of the university\u2019s centralized booking program results in reduced travel-related costs. However, as travel pricing is dynamic, there are times when a fare or rate may not reflect the least expensive price. The university continually evaluates its relationships with travel booking partners to ensure that services are provided at reasonable cost and are generally consistent with those offered by other commercial booking sources.\nIn addition, at a holistic level, the university can more efficiently steward its resources through the centralized booking program by reducing the administrative burden related to payment and reimbursement processes and tools, time searching for cost comparisons, and effort tracking the needed documentation. \nMore information is detailed in the Travel Policy section in this administrative guide memo.\nb. Stewardship of Resources\nAs stated in the University Code of Conduct (AGM 1.1.1), members of the Stanford University Community are expected to employ sound business practices and exercise prudent financial management in their stewardship of university resources. As such, individuals using university resources for business, travel expenses, and/or to purchase items to be owned by Stanford share the responsibility of ensuring that these resources are used appropriately, support the university mission, and comply with university policies, applicable laws and regulations, and sponsor and donor restrictions.\nSpecifically, expenses incurred in the course of university-related business must be reasonable and necessary. \nReasonable means that the nature and amount of the expense does not exceed that which a prudent person would incur under the same circumstances. While these amounts may vary, a good test is whether the individual could defend the expense if it came under public scrutiny. \nA necessary expense is one that supports and furthers the university mission and its ongoing operation.\nThe university has established limits on maximum university reimbursement for specific types of business and travel expenses, including meals, air and ground transportation, and hotel lodging. The limits, details and associated processes for these reimbursements are available on the Fingate website. It is the responsibility of the individual incurring expenses, as well as those who assist others with incurring expenses and those involved in the preparation and approval of reimbursement requests or financial transactions, to exercise good stewardship of university funds and to adhere to the reimbursement policies. For more information on these various roles and responsibilities, see AGM 3.2.1: Responsibility for University Funds.\nTravel and business expenses that do not reflect good stewardship of university resources, are found to benefit the individual at the expense of the University, and/or are deemed excessive or fraudulent will be subject to further review by the appropriate office (e.g. Office of Chief Risk Officer or School/Unit Office) as outlined in AGM 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities. Consequences of substantiated financial irregularities include denial of reimbursement, future business expense or travel restrictions and appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the University.\n2. Travel Policy\nStanford is committed to supporting domestic and international research, business, and educational travel that advances the university\u2019s mission, except when circumstances pose a significant risk to health or safety. Exigent circumstances may necessitate additional restrictions or guidance with regard to travel on behalf of the university.\nTo ensure the safety of the Stanford community, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students must engage in thoughtful planning of their travels well in advance and fully utilize the university resources that are available to them. Before purchasing or booking travel, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students must ensure compliance with university, local, state and federal guidelines, as well as with all relevant regulations in their travel destination. \nDefinition of University-Sponsored Travel\nUniversity-sponsored travel is defined as when the university pays directly or reimburses individuals for travel expenses that are necessary and appropriate to conduct university business. This includes the use of any funding source for which the university has financial responsibility and accountability, including operating budgets, donor gifts, federally-sponsored grants and awards, and any other restricted or unrestricted fund. Student and postdoctoral scholar travel that is directly related to their individual course of study, or for which academic credit may be awarded, is considered university-sponsored travel, even if the travel is funded via their base financial support.\nUniversity-sponsored travel may occur within or outside of the local area. Travel is considered outside of the local area when the destination is 50 miles or more one way from the traveler\u2019s home or Stanford\u2019s historic campus, whichever is greater. This definition is applicable to some travel expense policies, for example, hotel lodging reimbursement, where the university will only pay for hotel lodging expenses when the trip is outside of the local area. The location of an employee's residence (i.e., county) also applies when determining eligibility for reimbursement of certain travel expenses. See AGM: 2.1.21: Remote Work Arrangements.\nTravel Booking \nAs stated in Guiding Principles, it is highly encouraged that Stanford travelers use Stanford Travel booking channels when booking flights, hotels, and rental cars for university-sponsored travel. While Stanford Travel booking channels are a great option for most domestic and international travel, there are certain types of travel that need to be booked directly with the airline or hotel. These may include regional air travel offered by local carriers, travel for field research, ticket exchanges or reissues, or certain group reservations. See the Airfare and Lodging pages for more detail on booking and managing those travel arrangements. For information on the booking processes for various types of travelers, see Topic Overview: Travel Process.\nTravel booking for Stanford Healthcare, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory employees should follow the policies and processes of their respective organization.\nSplit or Partially Funded Travel\nWhen travel expenses for Stanford faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, or students will be shared by Stanford University and one or more external organizations, even if only a minority of the travel expenses are sponsored by Stanford, the trip is considered split.\nSplit travel is considered university-sponsored travel and any portion of travel that will be paid for by Stanford must follow the Business and Travel Expense Policies detailed here and on the Fingate website. Stanford Travel booking channels may be used for travel expenses that are being paid for by Stanford.\nIf it is not easy to separate out the costs that will be covered by the external party, the Stanford Travel Card may be used to pay for the total cost of the trip, then Stanford must be reimbursed by the traveler or travel arranger for the external party portion. See How To Return Personal Expenses Charged to a Travel Card.\nFully Externally-sponsored Travel\nWhen an outside institution or entity asks Stanford faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, or students to travel on that organization\u2019s behalf and provides full payment for those travel expenses, the trip is considered fully externally sponsored, also referred to as third-party travel.\nStanford University resources may not be used to book, purchase or reimburse expenses for fully externally-sponsored travel. In these instances, the use of the Stanford Travel Card and advances are prohibited, and travel arrangements may not be booked via Stanford Travel booking channels.\nPaying for Travel\nGenerally, the Stanford Travel Card (TCard) is the preferred payment method for travel costs that will not be reimbursed through the per diem method. Alternatively, personal funds may be used and a request for reimbursement can be submitted after the trip. \nPersonal Travel\nWhen a personal component of travel is added to a business trip, the university will only pay for or reimburse the costs of the business component. The charge that would have been incurred without that personal component must be documented via a comparison from a Stanford booking channel at the time of booking in order to appropriately process the reimbursement.\nThe Travel Card may be used to pay for trips that include a component of personal travel that may not be easily separated from the booking, but it may not be used to purchase trips that are exclusively personal. In cases where the Travel Card is used to purchase trips with a personal component, the individual is responsible for reimbursing the university for the extra cost.\nFor more information about paying for travel, refer to the Purchasing and Payment Methods on Fingate.\nProhibited Travel\nUniversity funds or resources may not be used where Stanford prohibits travel. See, for instance, the Stanford International Travel Policy as it relates to undergraduate students. \nTravel Restrictions\nStanford University may strongly recommend against or restrict travel to or within countries where the U.S. Department of State has issued certain official Travel Advisory levels, where there is other reliable information of significant health or safety risks, and/or where exigent circumstances apply. Detailed guidance can be found in the Stanford International Travel Policy. When planning travel, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students should first review traveler health and safety guidelines as well as information about any travel restrictions on the Office of International Affairs and Environmental Health & Safety websites.\n3. Reimbursement Policy: IRS Accountable Plan and Regulations Compliance\nThe university reimburses individuals under the IRS Accountable Plan when the IRS regulations are met. Under this plan, the reimbursement is not taxable as income to the employee if the expense has a business connection and is also submitted in a timely manner (see sections below). In addition to expenses being reasonable and necessary, the requirements for reimbursement under the IRS Accountable Plan include the following:\na. Business Connection and Substantiation of Expense \nExpenses incurred must have a business connection; that is, they must have been paid or incurred while performing Stanford business. The business connection must be adequately explained and documented in the University\u2019s records. Documentation must include:\nThe Business Purpose, which should clearly and without need for interpretation:\nExplain how the business expense is connected to the university and supports its mission; and\nInclude sufficient documentation to support the business purpose and alignment to the purpose of the funds, such as agendas or travel itinerary.\nDocumentation demonstrating that the amounts incurred are reasonable based on the facts and circumstances, and specific explanation when they have deviated from university guidelines.\nb. Timeliness of Transaction\nA transaction must be prepared and submitted into the Expense Requests system in Oracle Financials with all appropriate receipts or backup documentation within 60 days after the end of travel (for travel expenses), the expense posted date (for non travel expenses), or expected clearing date (for advances). Reimbursable expenses submitted after 60 days are subject to treatment as taxable income. See Topic Overview: Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions for information on how to manage expense reports, Purchasing Card, Travel Card, and advance transactions with regard to timing.\nc. Non-employee Travel: Students and Visitors\nIn addition, if the individual incurring the expense is not an employee of the university, additional requirements apply:\nAn undergraduate, graduate or post-doctoral student incurring the travel expense must be certified as traveling on university business by the appropriate signatory. Review Student Travel policy on Fingate.\nExpenses incurred by foreign visitors may only be reimbursed if the visitor enters the United States on an appropriate visa (see Guide Memo 2.4.1: Visas for and Employment of Foreign Nationals).\n4. Examples: Reimbursable and Non-reimbursable Business Expenses\nBelow are examples of reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses. For a complete list and more information, see Business and Travel Expense Policies on Fingate.\na. Examples of Reimbursable Business Expenses\nBusiness-related airfare, hotel lodging, travel meals, transportation, and conference registration fees;\nBusiness meals at a restaurant or catered by an approved supplier, attended by those necessary to achieve a business outcome;\nOccasional employee morale activities, local retreat and team-building events.\nb. Examples of Non-reimbursable Expenses\nSpousal travel expenses to accompany Stanford employees or visitors on university-sponsored business travel, unless approved in advance by the Provost;\nBusiness class airfare for domestic travel, unless an approved and current medical exemption is on file;\nFirst class airfare, unless business class would be allowed under policy but is not available;\nFrequent traveler programs or memberships, including the purchase of or redemption of miles/points;\nGifts to individuals celebrating personal events, for example for: birthdays, baby showers, bridal showers, weddings, graduations;\nPersonal membership and club fees, such as airline clubs and individual Stanford Faculty Club dues;\nTravel or domestic car rental insurance, unless in Hawaii or Alaska;\nParking fees, permits or transportation expenses related to employees commuting to their Primary Stanford Work Location (in alignment with AGM 2.1.20: Hybrid (Telecommuting) Work Arrangements and AGM 2.1.21: Remote Work Arrangements);\nTraffic citation for either personal or university vehicles;\nInterest charges for late payment of bills;\nPersonal items included in a purchase of items to be owned by Stanford.\n5.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/administrative-guide-policy-162-privacy-and-security-health-information", "text": "1.6.2 Privacy and Security of Health Information (HIPAA)\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 16.2\nThis Guide Memo describes Stanford University's implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") and its regulations (\"Privacy Rule\" and \"Security Rule\") governing the protection of identifiable health information by health care providers and health plans. The portions of Stanford University that are impacted by HIPAA include the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan, defined in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.\nThis Guide Memo references Stanford University HIPAA Components policies on the University HIPAA website and the Group Health Plan HIPAA policies. The Group Health Plan maintains HIPAA policies and procedures in the Resource Library section of the Benefits website. These policies outline more specific rights of individuals regarding their protected health information (\"PHI\") as well as the operational and system requirements to comply with the Privacy and Security Rules.\nApplicability: This policy applies to all staff, faculty, physicians, volunteers, students, consultants, contractors and subcontractors who are part of the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Stanford University Group Health Plan (\"Group Health Plan\") workforce. Stanford Health Care (\"SHC\"), including Menlo Health Alliance and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (\"LPCH\"), and their respective ERISA health benefit plans have separate HIPAA policies.\n1. The Privacy Rule\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") Privacy Rule limits Stanford University's use and disclosure of information that could potentially associate an individual's identity with their health information. Stanford University may not use or disclose PHI except as authorized by the individual, or as permitted or required by law. Use or disclosure of health information that does not have the potential to reveal an individual's identity is not limited.\n2. The Security Rule\nThe Security Rule requires Stanford University to implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI maintained in an electronic form (\"ePHI\") and to protect ePHI against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards, unauthorized uses or disclosures. The Security Rule protects ePHI stored in University systems during processing and during transmission\n3. Stanford University HIPAA Components Designation\nThe portions of Stanford University that provide health care, or share PHI with those portions, are \"health care components\" and are known collectively as the \"Stanford University HIPAA Components.\" Stanford University has authorized its Privacy Officer to designate the health care components to be included in the Stanford University HIPAA Components. A list of the schools, departments and functions designated as part of the Stanford University HIPAA Components can be found on the Stanford University HIPAA website or requested from the University Privacy Officer. Anyone who believes that their department or program uses or discloses PHI and ought to be designated as part of the Stanford University HIPAA Components should contact the University Privacy Officer.\nIn addition, the Stanford University HIPAA Components have joined Stanford Health Care (\"SHC\"), including Menlo Health Alliance and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford (\"LPCH\") which are together referred to as the \"Hospitals,\" to form a single affiliated entity under the Privacy and Security Rules, known as the Stanford Affiliated Covered Entity. By combining as a single affiliated entity, the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Hospitals have the greatest flexibility to share information with one another to accomplish their missions.\n4. Group Health Plan\nAs an employer, Stanford University sponsors and maintains various ERISA health benefits plans that comprise the Group Health Plan. The Group Health Plan is a separate covered entity from the Stanford University HIPAA Components and, as such, has separate HIPAA privacy and security policies. The list of the plans included in the Group Health Plan can be found on the Stanford University HIPAA website or requested from the University Privacy Officer.\n5. Privacy and Security Information\na. Privacy Officials\nStanford University has designated a HIPAA privacy officer (the \"University Privacy Officer\") for the Stanford University HIPAA Components, the Stanford Affiliated Covered Entity and the Group Health Plan. The University Privacy Officer is responsible for the development and implementation of the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Privacy Rule. Contact information for the University Privacy Officer is located in Section 13.\nThe University Privacy Officer may request that local privacy officials be designated by a school, department or program included in the Stanford University HIPAA Components or by the Group Health Plan (collectively and individually referred to as \"Program\") as necessary in order to implement the policies within their program effectively. Programs will promptly comply with any such request.\nb. Security Officials\nStanford University has designated a HIPAA security officer (the \"Chief Information Security Officer\") for the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan. The Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for the security of Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan ePHI, including development of the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the Security Rule and the implementation of security measures to protect ePHI. Contact information for the Chief Information Security Officer is located in Section 13.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer may designate local security officials (\"delegates\") as necessary to facilitate the implementation of policies, local procedures, and security measures.\n6. Policies and Procedures\nThe University Privacy Officer has developed policies and guidelines designed to keep the Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan in compliance with the Privacy Rule. The University Privacy Officer may add or modify policies and guidelines as necessary and appropriate to incorporate changes in the law or to improve the effectiveness of compliance with the Privacy Rule.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer has developed policies and guidelines to comply with the Security Rule and may add or modify those policies and guidelines as necessary and appropriate to improve Security Rule compliance.\nEach of the Stanford University HIPAA Components programs and the Group Health Plan must develop, implement, document, and train its workforce on the procedures necessary to comply with the appropriate HIPAA policies and this Administrative Guide Memo. For information concerning specific program procedures, workforce members should contact the local privacy or security official, as appropriate, or their supervisor.\nPrograms will comply with requests by the University Privacy Officer, the Chief Information Security Officer, the Office of the General Counsel and/or the Internal Audit Department to make written procedures and training materials available for review.\n7. Safeguards\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan will institute reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PHI from any intentional, incidental or unintentional use or disclosure that is in violation of the requirements of HIPAA, the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule or the Stanford University HIPAA policies.\nPlease see the Stanford University HIPAA website for more details.\n8. Training\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan will train members of their respective workforces, including management, on the Stanford University privacy and security policies and Program procedures to the extent necessary or appropriate for the members of the workforce to carry out their functions. New members of the workforce for whom HIPAA training is necessary or appropriate will be trained prior to initial contact with PHI and in no event later than 30 days from the first date of employment. Each member of the workforce whose functions are affected by a material change in the policies or procedures will be trained on those changes in a timely manner, but normally not later than 30 working days from the effective date of the change. Programs will document that workforce training has been completed and will retain these records in the format requested by the University Privacy Officer and Chief Information Security Officer. Training documentation will be provided on request to the University Privacy Officer or the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe Chief Information Security Officer will implement a security awareness program to instruct all workforce members on good security practices. The content of the security awareness program will include, but not be limited to information about (a) guarding against, detecting and reporting malicious software, (b) monitoring login attempts and reporting discrepancies, and (c) creating, changing and safeguarding passwords. The program will include periodic updates and reminders on pertinent security measures and issues, including environmental and operational changes affecting the security of ePHI.\n9. Violations\nAnyone who knows or has reason to believe that the Privacy Rule and/or Security Rule, the Stanford University HIPAA policies, the policies contained in this Administrative Guide Memo, or any Program procedure developed to implement these regulations and policies have been violated should report the matter promptly to their supervisor, a local HIPAA official, the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, as appropriate. All reported matters will be investigated in a timely manner and, when possible, will be handled confidentially.\nSee Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving Violations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security.\nIf the workforce member requires anonymity, their may also report such matters to the Institutional Compliance Hotline. If the workforce member does not have internet access, their may contact Institutional Compliance at (650) 721-COMP or 721-2667.\nTo the extent practical, any known harmful effect from a violation of the Privacy Rule or the Security Rule or a security incident will be mitigated. Where appropriate, sanctions will be considered and imposed by the program and/or the University. Programs should document all investigations, resolutions, remedies and sanctions, and forward a copy of such documentation to the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, as appropriate.\n10. Refraining from Intimidating or Retaliatory Attacks\nThe Stanford University HIPAA Components and Group Health Plan will not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or take other retaliatory action against any patient, physician, employee, or any other person for exercising their rights, or for participating in any process, established under the Privacy Rule or Security Rule, including submitting a complaint or reporting a violation. Any attempt to retaliate against a person for reporting a violation in accordance with Section 9 above, may itself be considered a violation of this policy and may result in sanctions. An individual who raises concerns about any act or practice allegedly made unlawful by the Privacy Rule or the Security Rule, however, must have a good faith belief that the act or practice is unlawful, and the manner of raising such concerns must be reasonable and not violate the Privacy Rule or Security Rule.\n11. Sanctions\nViolations of the Privacy Rule or Security Rule may, under certain circumstances, result in civil or criminal penalties. Members of the workforce who violate the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, policies contained in this Guide Memo or the Stanford University HIPAA policies, or any program's procedures implementing these policies, may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, contract, or other relationship with the University.\nSee Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving Violations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security.\n12. Evaluation and Reporting\nEach program will provide to the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer all requested information in order that the University Privacy Officer or Chief Information Security Officer may (a) adequately address complaints, (b) respond to requests from the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or other HHS official, and (c) inform Stanford University or Hospital leadership about compliance with the Privacy and Security Rules.\nStanford University HIPAA Components and the Group Health Plan will periodically, and when deemed necessary in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI (e.g., newly identified security risks, newly adopted technologies), conduct a technical and non-technical evaluation of its security safeguards to establish the extent to which its security policies and procedures meet the requirements of the Security Rule, and document its compliance with the Security Rule.\n13. For More Information\nQuestions: If you have questions about these policies, please contact your supervisor. Department management should contact the appropriate program official and/or the University Privacy Officer (with respect to the Privacy Rule) or the Chief Information Security Officer (with respect to the Security Rule) with any questions related to the interpretation of these policies and/or the development of departmental procedures. It is important that all questions be resolved as soon as possible to ensure compliance with the Privacy Rule and Security Rule.\nUniversity Privacy Office, privacy@stanford.edu or call (650) 725-1828\nInformation Security Office, securityofficer@stanford.edu\n14. Appendix A: Guidelines for the Implementation of Corrective Action in Matters Involving Violations of Patient, Research Participant and other Medical Information Privacy or Security\nOVERVIEW\nStanford University is committed to conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and University policies. The University endeavors to provide a strong infrastructure that promotes a culture committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of patient, medical and research participant information. These guidelines serve a dual purpose. They provide faculty, staff, trainees, students, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and other members of the Stanford community (\"workforce members\") notice of the consequences they will face for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\"), the Health Information Technology Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (\"COMIA\"), or other federal and state laws and regulations governing the confidentiality and security of patient information (\"applicable laws\"), or University policies relating to privacy and security of patient, medical and research participant information.\nSeparately, the guidelines provide University offices (e.g., privacy offices, human resources, academic and student affairs offices) and individual managers direction in determining appropriate consequences for workforce members who violate applicable laws or University policies that safeguard protected health information (\"PHI\") and other patient medical information. These guidelines should be used in conjunction with the corrective action or discipline policy applicable to the relevant workforce member including:\nGuide Memo 1.1.1:Code of Conduct\nGuide Memo 2.1.16: Addressing Conduct and Performance Issues\nCollective Bargaining Agreement between SEIU Local 2007 and Stanford Section 12.7\nFaculty Handbook Chapter 4.3 (Statement on Faculty Discipline)\nThe Fundamental Standard for Students\nMD Program Handbook Chapter 8 (Committee on Performance, Professionalism & Promotion)\nResearch Policy Handbook Chapter 10 (Non Faculty Research Appointments)\nFor definitions pertaining to HIPAA and frequently asked questions relating to HIPAA and other applicable laws relating to the protection of patient health information, see the University's HIPAA website.\nPRINCIPLES\nA. Imposition of Appropriate Sanctions\nWorkforce members will be sanctioned appropriately in the event that they:\naccess, use or disclose more than the minimum PHI necessary to complete their job-related functions;\nfail to adequately protect PHI in accordance with Stanford University's information security policies;\nfail to promptly report a known or suspected HIPAA violation; or\nviolate any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines.\nSanctions may also be imposed for failure to report a known or suspected HIPAA violation or for violating any of Stanford University's other HIPAA policies, procedures or guidelines. Sanctions for violations of HIPAA may include, without limitation, counseling, written warning, suspension, and termination. A workforce member's compensation and eligibility to continue in an academic or training program may also be impacted in the event of a violation. These guidelines are not intended to dictate a particular consequence in any particular situation. Rather, in consultation with the appropriate Human Resources and/or Privacy Office, managers, academic affairs and student affairs administrators have the discretion to decide:\nat which level to start the corrective action process based on the severity of the offense, the potential or actual harm to the patient and/or the Hospital(s) or University, and any mitigating factors; and\nwhether immediate termination is justified based on the seriousness of the offense.\nB. Levels of Violations\nThe level of a violation is determined by the severity of the privacy or security breach, whether the breach was intentional or unintentional or motivated by malice or personal gain, and the impact on the patient and/or institution. The following outlines some, but not all, types of violations and categorizes them broadly according to likely severity.\nLevel 1:\nA workforce member carelessly or inadvertently accesses PHI without a job-related need to know, or carelessly or unintentionally reveals PHI to which their has authorized access. Examples of Level 1 violations include, but are not limited to:\nLeaving PHI in a public area in the workplace or disposing of it in the trash instead of shredding receptacles;\nMisdirecting faxes, emails or other documents that contain PHI;\nDiscussing PHI in public areas where the discussion could be overheard;\nOther behaviors reflecting carelessness or lack of judgment in handling PHI.\nLevel 2:\nA workforce member intentionally accesses PHI without authorization or seriously fails to protect PHI. Examples of Level 2 violations include, but are not limited to:\nIntentionally accessing or asking another to access PHI without a job-related need to know, the PHI or a friend, relative, co-worker, public personality or any other individual (including searching for the existence of a record or an address or phone number);\nLeaving paper files and records, computers, laptops, notebooks, smart phones or other devices containing PHI accessible and unattended;\nSharing log-in IDs and passwords with others;\nUsing personal email accounts (e.g., Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo), cloud computing, or other media or storage devices not approved by Stanford University for transmission or storage of PHI or not meeting required security standards (such as encryption, secure email, password protection);\nRemoving PHI from the Stanford University workplace without supervisor approval or failing to appropriately safeguard PHI if removed with supervisor approval or while in transit;\nOther behaviors reflecting intentional conduct or serious failure to safeguard PHI.\nLevel 3:\nA workforce member intentionally accesses, uses or discloses PHI without authorization, often motivated by willful disregard, malice or personal gain. A Level 3 violation is considered serious misconduct. Examples of Level 3 violations include, but are not limited to:\nIntentionally using or disclosing without a job-related need to know the PHI of a friend, relative, co-worker, public personality, or any other individual\u2019s PHI;\nAccessing, using or disclosing PHI for personal purposes or gain, or with an intent to harm the patient or any third party;\nDiscussing or disclosing PHI with any third party either directly or via social networking or blogging sites, such as Twitter and Facebook.\nIntentionally assisting an individual in gaining unauthorized access to PHI.\nJeopardizing the integrity of Stanford University\u2019s systems.\nFailing to cooperate during the investigation of a privacy or security incident.\nFalsifying information during a privacy investigation or reporting in bad faith or for malicious purposes.\nOther behaviors reflecting personal purpose or gain, malice or misconduct.\nC. Considerations in Evaluating Violation for Appropriate Sanctions\nFactors in determining appropriate disciplinary action may include, but are not limited to:\nWhether the breach was intentional or inadvertent;\nThe nature of the breach, including whether the breach involved specially protected information such as HIV, psychiatric, substance abuse, or genetic data;\nThe magnitude of the breach, including the number of patients and the volume of protected health information accessed, used or disclosed;\nThe workforce member\u2019s motive in accessing, using or disclosing PHI, and whether there was an element of malice or desire for personal gain; \nWhether the workforce member has committed prior HIPAA violations;\nThe workforce member\u2019s response or conduct during investigation;\nRisk of harm to the victim(s) of the breach or to the University;\nThe existence of any compelling, aggravating or mitigating factors.\nPROCEDURES\nA. Prompt Reporting and Investigation\nEach workforce member must report any alleged, apparent, or potential violations of HIPAA or applicable privacy and security laws promptly (within no more than twenty-four hours) to their supervisor/designee or to the supervisor's supervisor. Suspected violations shall be investigated appropriately and in coordination with the relevant supervisor, Human Resources officer, and the Privacy Officer. Matters involving faculty, students or trainees should also be brought to the attention of the appropriate senior associate dean(s) which may include:\nSenior Associate Deans for Clinical Affairs\u2014for events related to clinical faculty\nSenior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education\u2014for events related to medical students\nSenior Associate Dean for Finance and Administration\u2014for events related to any other individuals to whom this policy applies\nDean, Vice Dean and Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, as applicable\u2014for events related to faculty\nSenior Associate Dean for Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs\u2014for events related to graduate students or postdoctoral scholars\nResults of the investigation and any decision regarding discipline will be documented in writing and disciplinary actions will be made part of the workforce member\u2019s personnel, training or student file. Discipline will be issued in accordance with existing discipline or corrective action policies applicable to the particular workforce member. When faculty members are involved, the Senior Associate Dean shall be consulted, and the faculty member shall have the rights outlined in relevant faculty policies and grievance procedures. The cognizant vice president or dean, or their designee, retains final authority concerning sanctions and will review any sanction involving suspension, dismissal, or termination before it is implemented.\nIn the event of a possible violation of HIPAA or applicable law involving both University and SHC or LPCH personnel, the investigation must be coordinated and any correction actions or sanctions must be consistent between the organizations. Reports to state/federal oversight agencies may be required. In addition to any internal corrective action, employees may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, and referral to applicable licensing boards.\nB. Guidelines for Sanctions\nThe following will serve as guidelines for appropriate sanctions for violations of HIPAA or other applicable laws or policies.\nFaculty\nAppropriate sanctions will be imposed in accordance with the Statement on Faculty Discipline, Faculty Handbook section 4.3.\nEmployees, post-doctoral fellows, volunteers\nLevel 1. Violations shall, in most cases, result in oral or written counseling and/or retraining. Repeat Level 1 violations shall be subject to further disciplinary action up to and including termination.\nLevel 2. Violations shall, in most cases, result in a written disciplinary warning with or without an unpaid suspension, and retraining shall be required. Disciplinary action up to and including termination may be taken for repeat Level 2 violations.\nLevel 3. Violations, in most cases, shall result in immediate termination of employment, academic appointment or ending of a volunteer assignment.\nStudents enrolled in undergraduate or graduate degree programs\nLevel 1: Violations shall, in most cases, result in oral counseling and/or retraining. Repeat Level 1 violations shall be subject to progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination from the program of study.\nLevel 2: Violations shall, in most cases, result a written reprimand in the student\u2019s file and retraining. The student may also be suspended from the program of study.\nLevel 3: Violations, in most cases, shall result in immediate termination from the program of study.\nContractors/Vendors\nViolations of any level shall, in most cases, result in termination of the contract/business relationship and disqualification from future contractual/business relationships."}

Some common types of financial irregularities are corruption (e.g., bribery, kickbacks, bid riggings, etc.), conflicts of interest (e.g., sale and purchase schemes, etc.) and asset misappropriation involving cash, inventory or other University assets. Examples of asset misappropriation can include the following:\ntheft of cash\nthe use of a University issued credit card or the expense reimbursement system to make personal purchases\nthe directing of University resources such as supplies, inventory or labor to outside organizations\nthe directing of University revenues (e.g., event ticket proceeds, research funding, etc.) to outside organizations\nDepartments must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline of suspected financial irregularities. Departments should not initiate an investigation. Departments should not discuss, interview or confront individuals about the suspected financial irregularity. Departments should not initiate any disciplinary actions without specific direction from the Office of General Counsel, or the Office of the Chief Risk Officer.\n1. Notification\nThe department where the alleged financial irregularity is suspected or discovered must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Compliance and Ethics helpline, at (650)-721-2667 or helpline.stanford.edu. Preliminary research will be conducted to determine if an investigation is warranted. In general, there must be an adequate basis for suspecting a possible illegal or improper act and sufficient information available to conduct an investigation.\n2. Investigation Process\nWhen warranted by information obtained during preliminary research, the Office of the Chief Risk Officer will commence a fact-finding investigation into the suspected financial irregularity. Depending on the circumstances, the Office of the General Counsel may decide to direct the investigation. If an investigation is commenced, the Office of the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, and all appropriate stakeholders will be notified. These may include representatives from the following offices:\nDepartment where the alleged financial irregularity is suspected or discovered, unless the local senior management is alleged to be involved or there is concern that informing local management could compromise the outcome of the investigation\nFinancial Management Services, including the Controller's Office, Office of the Treasurer, Procurement, Global Services, and Financial Management Consulting and Support\nUniversity Human Resources\nStudent Affairs\nDean's, Vice Provost's or Vice President's Office to which the department reports\nProvost's Office\nDepartment of Public Safety (if the report involves allegations of criminal activity)\nThe Office of the Chief Risk Officer will plan and coordinate the investigation and will consult with the Office of the General Counsel as appropriate. In most cases, a report will be provided to the appropriate University office(s), which summarizes findings on the alleged financial irregularity and makes recommendations for improvement of related internal controls."}

You can find a complete list of certified U.S. flag air carriers on transportation.gov.\nThis requirement applies to\nFederal government employees and their dependents\nConsultants, contractors, and grantees\nOther travelers whose travel is paid for by the federal government\nYou cannot cross the U.S. border to use a foreign airline to avoid being subject to the Fly America Act. If your travel does not comply with the Fly America Act, the government will not reimburse your airline ticket.\nAuthority for the Fly America Act comes from 49 U.S.C. 40118.\nCodesharing\nOccasionally, two or more airlines will \"codeshare\" a flight by publishing and marketing the same flight under their own airline designators and flight numbers. You can purchase a seat on each airline\u2019s designator and flight number, but the flight is only operated by one of the cooperating airlines. To comply with Fly America regulations, you must purchase the flight via the U.S. airline\u2019s designator and flight number if the flight is shared between a U.S. and a foreign airline.\nExceptions to the Fly America Act\nThere are some circumstances where it\u2019s not reasonable to use a U.S. flag air carrier, and you can make an exception to the Fly America Act. These circumstances are:\nWhen a U.S. air carrier is not available.\nWhen using a U.S. carrier service would extend the travel time by 24 hours or more.\nWhen a U.S. carrier does not offer a nonstop or direct flight between origin and destination, and using a U.S. carrier: \nIncreases the number of aircraft changes outside the United States by two or more;\nExtends travel time by six hours or more; or\nRequires a connecting time of four hours or more at an overseas interchange point.\nWhen the flight time from origin to destination is less than three hours and using a U.S. flag carrier doubles the flight time.\nWhen there is an applicable Open Skies Agreement in effect that meets the requirements of the Fly America Act.\nThe exceptions provided by the Open Skies Agreements for government-funded travel do not apply if your transportation is funded by the Department of Defense.\nNote: Ticket cost and convenience are NOT exceptions to the Fly America Act.\nOpen Skies Agreements\n\"Open Skies Agreements\" are bilateral or multilateral agreements between the U.S. Government and the governments of foreign countries that allow travelers to use foreign air carriers from these countries for government-funded international travel. Many Open Skies Agreements exist but only (4) four agreements meet Fly America Act requirements which the key factor is the statement for \"U.S. Government Procured Transportation: in either the Article or Annex of the agreement.\nThe United States currently has Open Skies Agreements in effect with:\nEuropean Union (28 countries) (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, including Iceland and Norway)\nAustralia\nSwitzerland\nJapan\nThe agreement with the European Union permits the use of an EU air carrier for travel outside the United States. Iceland and Norway are not EU members, but are members of the EU air treaty.

Purpose of Record Retention\nRetaining records serves two purposes. In the short-term, it provides those responsible for the management of accounts with the means to monitor transactions and resolve problems. In the long-term, it enables the University to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service regulations, and other federal, state and local regulations governing auditability and retention of records.\n2. Responsibility\na. Online Transactions\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is online, the central administrative office responsible for maintaining the online application is responsible for retaining the online transaction record.\nb. Paper Documents\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is paper, the office that receives the original document is responsible for retaining it. The submitting department is responsible for retaining the support until the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report. Originating departments have the responsibility to destroy any paper backup once central administration has successfully processed the reimbursement request, has a copy of the scanned supporting documentation and the transaction has posted to the monthly expenditure report.\nExceptions:\nFor Federal contracts, a copy of the original paper copy must be retained for one year past the date it was scanned;\neither a paper copy or scanned copy of the monthly grant and contract expenditure statements or quarterly certification statement signed by the principal investigator and task manager should be retained by the department in accordance with the \"Direct Charges and Revenues to Contracts and Grants\" retention policy.\n3. Retention Times\na. Minimum Paper and Electronic Record Retention TimesLegal and Audit Requirements\nWhen requirements for long-term retention of records overlap, the responsible office should retain records for the maximum period needed to meet legal and audit requirements. In special cases retention times may be extended by request of the central offices. In such a situation the affected will be notified in writing. General rules:\nTax-Exempt Debt Related Records: Life of the bond issue, plus the life of any issue that refunds the issue, plus six years. Records related to tax-exempt debt include but are not limited to documentation of the use of the debt proceeds (project costs), how debt financed property is used, relevant sponsored research contracts and grants in facilities financed with tax-exempt debt, relevant third party leases of space, etc. Detailed information can be found under the Compliance Guidelines for Tax-Exempt Bonds. \nDirect Charges and Revenues to Contracts and Grants: Four years following the end date of the award (longer if circumstances related to tax-exempt financing require it, see Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records above).\nTransactions involving depreciable assets: \nMoveable equipment records (not financed with tax-exempt debt) will be centrally retained three years beyond the disposal of the asset.\nTransaction records involving other depreciable assets will be retained six years beyond the asset becoming fully depreciated (longer if circumstances related to tax-exempt financing require it, see Tax-Exempt Debt Related Records above.)\nBusiness Transaction Records (not contract or grant-related): Four years.\nEmployee Payroll Information: Six years from retirement or termination.\nTaxable Income (Cash receipt information and billings, and all documents for activities considered unrelated business income.

Current rates are maintained by the Cost & Management Analysis Office.\n1. Introduction\nFacilities & Administrative (F&A) Rates (also known as indirect cost rates) and fringe benefits rates are established in accordance with the federal government's Office of Management and Budget. These rates are negotiated between Stanford and the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the cognizant federal agency overseeing the administration of sponsored agreements at Stanford.\nAll proposals to sponsors must include budget requests for F&A costs and fringe benefits, using the rates negotiated by Stanford and provided by Cost and Management Analysis (CMA), unless a reduced rate is approved by the Vice Provost and Dean of Research (or for the Medical School, by the Dean of the School of Medicine or designee) on a case-by-case basis. The Office of the Dean of Research maintains a separate list of entities whose published policies specify rates lower than Stanford's, where the lower rate has been approved by the University.\nProposals to these sponsors may be submitted to the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) using the rates indicated on that list without prior approval by the Vice Provost and Dean of Research (or Dean of the School of Medicine). See RPH: Indirect Cost Waivers.\n2. Application of On- and Off-Campus Facilities & Administrative Rates\nF&A (indirect cost) and fringe benefit rates are applicable to all externally-sponsored projects (grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, subgrants, and subcontracts) funded by federal, state or private sponsors. The application of these rates allows Stanford University to recover certain costs (e.g. facilities, utilities, libraries, administration, student services, etc.) associated with externally-funded training and research activity.\nA. Definition of \"Off Campus\"\nA project, or part of a project, is considered to be performed off-campus if the activity is conducted at a location other than Stanford University's academic lands and the majority of F&A (indirect costs), e.g., operation and maintenance, depreciation or lease of buildings, equipment and improvements, associated with the University's facilities, both owned and leased, is not applicable. If a project is located in leased space and the lease is a direct charge to the project, then the project is considered off-campus; if the project is not charged directly for the lease cost and the lease is a part of the University's F&A (indirect cost) rate, then the project is considered on-campus. In other words, the classification of on- or off-campus is solely for the purpose of applying the correct F&A (indirect cost) rate.\nThe off-campus F&A rate will not be applied when members of a research group conduct research via telework from a residence because Stanford\u2019s research operating costs continue to incur and apply when project personnel work from their home. Remote working is a privilege that does not change how the university applies the indirect cost rate.\nB. Projects Conducted Partially Off-Campus\nThe on- or off-campus determination shall be based on the Stanford portion of project costs and not include costs of a collaborating entity. \"Project\" refers to the grant or contract award to Stanford University, not including collaborating entities.\nGrant or Contract Award Under $100,000 in Modified Total Direct Costs\nProjects of this size which are partially performed off-campus are not apportioned between their on-campus and off-campus components for F&A rate purposes. If 50% or more of the project's MTDCs is to be expended on campus, the entire project is charged the on-campus F&A rate. If more than 50% of the MTDC is determined to be off campus, the entire project is charged the off-campus F&A rate.\nGrant or Contract Award of $100,000 or More in Modified Total Direct Costs\nMTDC for projects of this size which are partially performed off-campus is apportioned between on-campus and off-campus components for F&A rate application purposes in instances where the lesser component is 20% or more of the MTDC of the project. If the lesser component is under 20%, the entire project is charged the F&A rate of the larger component, i.e. if the on-campus MTDC component is larger, the entire project is charged the on-campus F&A rate.\n3. Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC)\nMTDC is the base to which F&A (indirect cost) rates are applied. OMB\u2019s Uniform Guidance defines this base for sponsored projects awarded on or after December 26, 2014 as follows:\nMTDC means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000. Other items may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs, and with the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\nUse expenditure type 52436 for participant support costs for all federally sponsored projects awarded on or after December 26, 2014.\nThe expenditure type for Participant Support Costs must not be used on non-federally sponsored projects unless required by the sponsor. Categorize such costs using the expenditure types for travel, stipend, etc.\nPrior to December 26, 2014 the OMB Circular A-21 definition of MTDC did not exclude participant support costs. NSF was the only agency that excluded participant support costs from MTDC.\nUse expenditure type 54235 for participant costs for NSF sponsored projects awarded prior to December 26, 2014.\nSee additional expenditure types for interdepartmental charging of participant support costs.\nAs specified in this definition, some costs are excluded from Total Direct Costs (TDC) to arrive at the MTDC base to which F&A (indirect cost) rates are applied. OMB\u2019s Uniform Guidance and A-21 also provides for exclusions of other items of cost where necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of costs. Any questions about the MTDC base should be directed to the Cost and Management Analysis Office (CMA). Specific application of F&A to individual expenditure types should be directed to the Research Administration Policy & Compliance Office (RAPC).\nA. Application of Facilities & Administrative Rates Using Modified Total Direct Costs or Total Direct Costs\nFor Federally-sponsored Projects\nThe MTDC base shall be used when a Federal sponsor's published F&A rate is less than the current full ONR-negotiated rate, but does not specify a base. The TDC base shall be used when a Federal sponsor prescribes use of the TDC base.\nFor Non-Federally-sponsored Projects\nThe TDC base shall be used when a non-Federal sponsor's published F&A rate is less than the current full ONR-negotiated rate.\nF&A waiver requirements are contained in RPH 15.2: Facility and Administrative (Indirect Cost) Waivers apply in all cases. Refer to the waiver list maintained by the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.\n4. Fringe Benefit Rates\nThe fringe benefits rates are applied to the appropriate \"salary and wage bases.\" As defined in Stanford's Negotiation Agreement, this base includes direct salaries and wages being charged to the project, including vacation, holidays, and sick leave. Salaries for graduate students with assistantship appointments are charged a Graduate Assistantship Rate which provides a health insurance subsidy. Salaries for temporary employees and those working less than half-time are charged the Contingent (casual/temporary) Employee Benefits Rate. Postdoctoral Scholars are charged the Postdoctoral Scholars Rate. All other employees are charged the Regular Employee Benefits Rate."}

Academic Staff are covered by Research Policy Handbook 4.4: Conflict of Commitment and Interest. This Guide Memo summarizes existing policies and practices applicable to other University employees. Additional University policies are applicable to employees in individual departments and units, e.g., SLAC, Sponsored Projects and Purchasing Services. Individuals who use the department's services must follow the department's policies.\nPurpose: When University staff members, or members of their immediate families (defined below), have significant financial interests in, or consulting or employment arrangements with, other business concerns, it is important to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest between their University obligations and their outside interests.\nIn addition to the conflict of interest concerns mentioned above\u2014which apply to all University staff\u2014Stanford staff members who are exempt from governmental regulations regarding compensation for overtime work owe their primary professional allegiance to the University. Care should be taken so that external activities do not result in inappropriate conflicts of commitment, i.e., conflicts regarding allocation of time and energies.\nIn order to preclude inappropriate actual or apparent conflicts of interest or conflicts of commitment, this Guide Memo sets forth related University policies and procedures.\n1. Definitions\na. Significant Financial Interest\nCurrent or pending ownership interest in an entity amounting to at least one-half percent (0.5%) of the company's equity or at least $10,000 in ownership interest (except when the ownership is managed by a third party such as a mutual fund).\nb. Immediate Family Member\nSpouse, dependent child as determined by the Internal Revenue Service, domestic partner.\nc. Cognizant University Officer\nPresident, Provost, Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts, Deans, Directors of SLAC, Hoover Institute and Athletics, and the University Librarian.\n2. Policy\nThe following actions on the part of staff members are prohibited:\na. Personal Gain\nTransmitting to outsiders or otherwise using for personal gain University-funded or supported property, work products, results, materials, property records or information developed with University funding or other support.\nb. Confidential or Privileged Information\nUsing for personal gain or other unauthorized purposes, confidential or privileged information acquired in connection with the individual's University-supported activities. Confidential or privileged information is non-public information pertaining to the operation of any part of the University including, but not limited to, documents so designated, medical, personnel, or security records of individuals; anticipated material requirements or price actions; knowledge of possible new sites for University-supported operations; knowledge of forthcoming programs or of selections of contractors or subcontractors in advance of official announcements; and knowledge of investment decisions. Questions about confidential information may be referred to the University Privacy Officer at privacyofficer@stanford.edu.\nc. Approvals\nParticipation in negotiating or giving final approval to financial or other business transactions between the University and other organizations in which the individual or an immediate family member has a Significant Financial Interest or with which the individual or an Immediate Family Member has an employment or consulting arrangement.\nAll staff should also note that originating or approving financial or other business transactions between the University and other organizations with which the staff member has any financial or family ties (even those not rising to the level of Significant Financial Interest or constituting an Immediate Family Member) may create the appearance of a conflict of interest. It is required that all such situations be disclosed in writing to the cognizant University officer and this disclosure should be documented and retained for the duration of the business relationship.\nd. Gratuities and Special Favors\nAcceptance of gratuities, unsolicited gifts exceeding $50 in value, solicited gifts in any amount or special favors from private or public organizations or individuals with which the University does or may conduct business or extending gratuities or special favors to employees of any sponsoring government or other agency or entity.\ne. University Resources\nUse of University resources including, but not limited to, facilities, departmental parking permits, personnel or equipment, except in a purely incidental way, for any purposes other than the performance of the individual's University employment. Note: Acceptable use of University vehicles is covered in Guide Memo 8.4.2: Vehicle Use.\nf. Business Relations\nAcceptance of or continuing in employment, an official relationship, or a consulting arrangement with another concern which has or seeks to have a business relationship with the University.\ng. Commitment\nFor staff members exempt from governmental regulations regarding compensation for overtime work: Acceptance of employment, consulting, public service, or pro bono work which can result in conflicts or the appearance of conflicts with a staff member's primary commitment of time and energy to the University.\n3. Procedures for Exceptions\nBecause it may be in the interest of the University to grant exceptions to the rules in Section 2, the following procedure has been established:\na. Disclosure\nWhenever a staff member anticipates a situation where their may be potentially in violation of the policies in Section 2, that staff member must immediately make full disclosure in writing of the details of the situation, through their supervisor, to the cognizant University officer and request an exception. Exceptions must be approved in writing in advance. If a staff member finds that their has engaged in conduct that violates the policies in Section 2, such situation must be reported immediately to the cognizant University officer.\nb. Responsibility of University Officers\nAny requests for exception shall be reviewed and all facts thoroughly examined for apparent conflicts. Exceptions may be granted at the sole discretion of the University. If the cognizant University officer determines that the University would best be served by the granting of the requested exception, they may do so in writing with justification for the granting and delineating any conditions placed on the approval. Except in rare instances, University officers may not delegate this responsibility and any delegation must be in writing. If the designee grants an exception, the designee must provide the University officer with a memorandum detailing the circumstances of the exception.\nCopies of the approval must be retained throughout the period of employment.\nc. Annual Reports\nUniversity officers who receive and grant exceptions to the policies in this Guide Memo shall, at the end of each academic year, provide a detailed summary report to the Provost.\nd. Other Reports\nIn addition to Section 3.c, cognizant University officers may establish, within their areas of responsibility, mandatory periodic conformance and compliance reporting procedures for all staff.\ne. Consequences\nFailure to adhere to any aspect of the policy and procedures shall subject the involved employee(s) to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/research-policy-handbook-openness-research", "text": "Openness in Research | DoResearch\nExpresses Stanford's commitment to openness in research; defines and prohibits secrecy, including limitations on publishability of results; specifies certain provisions that are acceptable under this policy.\n1. Resolved\nThat the principle of openness in research - the principle of freedom of access by all interested persons to the underlying data, processes, and to the final results of research - is one of overriding importance. Accordingly, it is the decision of the Senate that this principle be implemented so that no program of research that requires secrecy (as hereafter defined) be conducted at Stanford University, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 4. of this Resolution.\n2. A Research Program Shall be Regarded as Requiring Secrecy\nThat a research program shall be regarded as requiring secrecy:\nIf any part of the sponsoring or granting documents that establish the project is not freely publishable\nIf there is a reasonable basis for expectation that any documents to be generated in the course of the research project will be subjected by an outside sponsor to restrictions on publication for a period in excess of that reasonably required (more than 90 days) so that the sponsor can ascertain whether information he or she is entitled to have treated as confidential would be disclosed by publication\nIf access will be required in the course of the project to confidential data so centrally related to the research that a member of the research group who was not privy to the confidential data would be unable to participate fully in all of the intellectually significant portions of the project\n3. Rules Adopted by the Academic Council\nThe rules adopted by the Academic Council on September 29, 1967, are hereby amended and, as amended, are reaffirmed:\nNo research on a thesis or dissertation should be undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is any substantial possibility that it will lead to a secret thesis or dissertation.\nNo secret thesis or dissertation should be accepted as the basis for a degree.\nScholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny by the entire Advisory Board should not be considered in connection with appointments, reappointments or promotions.\nThe University should enter no contract and accept no grant to carry out research if the grant or contract restrains the freedom of the University to disclose the:\nExistence of the contract or grant or,\nGeneral nature of the inquiry to be conducted or,\nIdentity of the outside contracting or granting entity or,\nThe research results\nprovided that this clause shall not apply either (a) to anonymous gifts or grants that do not call for the performance of specified lines of inquiry, or (b) to research grants or contracts from individuals or non-governmental entities who request anonymity out of a justifiable motivation to protect individual privacy.\n4. Programs of Research With Certain Provisions That Are Allowable\nA. Living Human Beings\nIn a program of research involving the examination, through interview techniques or otherwise, of a living human being, reasonable provision may be made to protect the rights of that individual to privacy.\nB. National Security Controls\nIn a program of research, the purposes of which would be significantly advanced by access to information generated elsewhere that had been subjected to export or other national security controls, provision may be made for access to that information on the part of one of several of the participating investigators provided that the information falling under national security controls is peripheral to the research program in the following sense: the relationship between the data falling under national security controls and the overall research endeavor must be sufficiently remote so that\na member of the research group who is restricted from accessing the data falling under national security controls would nevertheless be able to participate fully in all of the intellectually significant portions of the project (i.e., would not be placed at an intellectual disadvantage by the access restriction); and\nthere is no substantial basis for an expectation that any part of the final results of the research, or any but a trivial part of the research processes, will be subject to restriction on publication more enduring than those described in Section 2.\nC. Publication Delays\nIn a program of sponsored research, provision may be made in the contractual agreement between Stanford and the sponsor for a delay in the publication of research results, in the following circumstances:\nFor a short delay (the period of delay not to exceed 90 days), for patenting purposes or for sponsor review of and comment on manuscripts, providing that no basis exists at the beginning of the project to expect that the sponsor would attempt either to suppress publication or to impose substantive changes in the manuscripts.\nFor a longer delay in the case of multi-site clinical research (the period of delay not to exceed 24 months from the completion of research at all sites), where a publication committee receives data from participating sites and makes decisions about joint publications. Such delays are permitted only if the Stanford investigator is assured the ability to publish without restrictions after the specified delay.\nWhen it is in the best interests of the research, the Vice Provost and Dean of Research may approve contractual arrangements that could lead to longer publication delays. Requests for the Dean to approve such contractual arrangements should include:\nthe rationale for the request\na description of who will have authority over publication decisions, and\na statement of the provisions that will allow the investigator to publish within a defined period of time, regardless of other considerations.\nUnder no circumstances should a faculty member engage a student or trainee in a project governed by an extended publication delay agreement or contractual arrangement that could present a barrier to the timely submission of the student's thesis or dissertation or to the publication of a trainee's work.\nD. Confidentiality\nIf, in a program of research, an outside person or entity has made available to the investigator confidential information, provision may be made to preserve confidentiality and/or a short delay in the publication of research results during which time the information source may examine the proposed publication in order to assure that the investigator has not disclosed, intentionally or unintentionally, any portion of the confidential information supplied, provided that any such provision for delay must contain assurance from the information source that they will conduct their review as expeditiously as possible, that they will not attempt to thwart publication for any reason except to protect confidential information previously supplied, and that they will indicate with specificity a sentence or sentences which they contend constitute such a disclosure.\nE. Private Papers, Documents, Diaries or Analogous Materials\nIf, in a program of research, private papers, documents, diaries or analogous materials have been provided to the investigator, provision may be made to preserve the confidentiality of those materials for the purpose of protecting the individual privacy of the author, or of the addressee.\n5. Review\nThis policy shall be reviewed at least annually by the Committee on Research in one of its meetings.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/administrative-guide-policy-533-purchasing-cards-pcards", "text": "5.3.3 Purchasing Cards | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 54.5\nThis Guide Memo contains policies on use of Purchasing Cards (PCard) to purchase goods or services directly by departments. This policy establishes the rules and guidelines for appropriate use of the Stanford-issued Purchasing Card. This policy is based on and in alignment with the expectations set forth by AGM 1.1.1: Code of Conduct, specifically with regard to employing sound business practices and exercising prudent financial management in the stewardship of University resources. For detailed guidance and supporting resources, see the Purchasing Card (PCard) overview on Fingate.\n1. Purpose\nStanford Purchasing Cards (PCards) are university-liability credit cards issued to active, authorized and trained Stanford employees to purchase eligible goods and services in support of Stanford University business. Only eligible business purchases that are $4,999 or less may be charged to the PCard; splitting transactions and personal purchases are strictly prohibited. All PCard transactions must be reviewed and verified in the PCard system and substantiated by adding a detailed and appropriate business purpose and proof of purchase documentation. See detailed policy and guidance for the PCard on Fingate.\nThere are two types of PCards: an individual PCard and a Department PCard. The individual PCard is issued to a specific person who is the cardholder and has direct responsibility for facilitating business transactions for a department. The Department PCard is issued to a department and assigned to an individual custodian, who acts as the cardholder. The custodian may use the card directly to facilitate business transactions for the department or may allow usage of the card by others within the department once verifying that the card will be used in alignment with any department and university policies. The policies are the same for both types of PCards, unless specifically noted.\nPCards should be used for smaller dollar items ($4,999 or less). iProcurement, which provides users with access to shop from Amazon Business and SmartMart catalog suppliers, is the preferred method for purchasing goods and services due to the university\u2019s greater ability to manage risk, compliance and regulations. Additional benefits of Amazon Business and SmartMart catalog suppliers include pre-vetted suppliers, pre-negotiated pricing and efficiencies such as repeat ordering and a streamlined invoice and payment process. Using a PCard instead of iProcurement to purchase items should be limited to instances where there is substantial benefit.\na. Responsibilities\nAll university business purchases must be substantiated within 60 days of the expense being incurred. For PCard transactions, this means that transactions must be verified (including appropriate documentation, business purpose and account information) and fully approved within 60 days of the charge being available for verification in the Oracle PCard module. A reasonable timeframe for verification is within 10 days of the charge appearing in the module. Failure to complete verification and approvals within 60 days may result in card suspension and/or expenditures (charges) reported as taxable income to the cardholder or individual custodian.\nIf a PCard transaction is not verified and approved within 60 days, the transaction will be force cleared by Financial Management Services to a department guarantee account (PTA.) This process occurs at the end of each fiscal quarter. The department is then responsible for allocating the force cleared transaction(s), via the iJournals system, to the appropriate account (PTA) and expenditure type.\nFor information on how to find and manage force cleared PCard transactions, visit Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions on Fingate.\nb. Verification and Approvals\nCardholders may verify their own transactions. However, all transactions must route to an approver that meets the following criteria:\n1. has authority over the account (PTA) charged,\n2. does not report directly or indirectly to the cardholder, and\n3. is not the beneficiary of the transaction.\nA detailed description of all roles and responsibilities is available from the Purchasing Card (PCard) overview on Fingate.\nc. Misuse\nParticipation in the PCard program is considered a privilege that carries the responsibility to ensure appropriate use and stewardship of University funds. Inappropriate use of the PCard may result in the loss of the privilege, disciplinary action and/or in termination of employment. Fraudulent use may additionally result in criminal prosecution. The cardholder/custodian or card user will be held personally liable for all unauthorized purchases.\n2. Authority to Purchase\na. Basic Criteria\nThe PCard is available to active Stanford University employees. Eligibility is based on a departmentally-determined business need and requires:\nCompletion of an online application providing: \na guarantee account (PTA)\nthe individual responsible for verifying PCard transactions\nApprovals from the requesting cardholder's manager or department chair/dean and the appropriate financial approver for the guarantee account (PTA) provided\nCompletion of required training\nFor more information, see Stanford\u2019s Purchasing Card (PCard) Program.\nb. Delegation of Authority\nIndividuals who have been authorized by their department for PCard use may purchase eligible goods and services, in accordance with the Purchasing Card Policy, for up to $4,999. These purchases must be reasonable and necessary, consistent with established university policies and practices, applicable to the work of the university, including instruction, research, and public service, and must be consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions.\nNote: The purchase cost includes tax, shipping, handling and installation, if applicable. The total purchase item cost cannot exceed $4,999.\nc. Department Responsibility\nDelegation of authority comes with the responsibility to adhere to University policies and procedures related to purchases.\n3. Permissible and Non-Permissible Purchases\nFor a complete list of permissible purchases, see policy and guidance for the PCard Departments may have more restrictive PCard policies. \na. Examples of permissible purchases ($4,999 or less):\nOffice supplies (only when there is substantial benefit to using a PCard rather than Amazon Business and SmartMart)\nPostage and mailing supplies and services\nPhotocopies and printing\nBooks (including departmental library materials)\nConference Registration/Training Fees where no travel is required\nDues and subscriptions\nMemberships to professional organizations\nGifts, awards, and food in support of employee morale (per Administrative Guide Policy: 2.2.10 Gifts and Awards for University Employees)\nService and retirement awards (per Administrative Guide Policy: 2.2.10 Gifts and Awards for University Employees)\nLocal business meals\nb. Non-permissible purchases\nPersonal Purchases\nAll PCard purchases must be for the benefit of the university; anything purchased for personal use may be considered a fraudulent transaction and may result in the consequences described in the 1. Purpose; c. Misuse section above.\nPurchases with Unique Compliance Requirements\nSome types of purchases are not permitted on a PCard due to the difficulty of complying with regulatory requirements, health and safety policies, tax reporting rules or the need for a contract or insurance to protect the university\u2019s interests. \nPurchases more Efficiently or Cost-Effectively Purchased via other Channels\nOther types of purchases are not permitted because the university provides a more efficient, cost-effective or controlled method to obtain the item.\nThe following list includes examples of items that may not be purchased using a PCard. Additional examples are available on the Stanford Purchasing Card Policy webpage.\nPersonal purchases of any kind\nAny purchase over $4,999\nSplit transactions (any purchase that would be over $4,999 if not split into multiple transactions.)\nComputers, software, mobile devices and related services to be obtained through purchasing methods recommended by UIT, such as \nElectronic and computing equipment\nCloud computing services\nMobile devices and accessories\nCapital equipment/fixed assets and fabrications. A fabrication is a unique item that cannot be acquired off-the-shelf, has a useful life of more than one year, and is made of components that cumulatively cost $5,000 or more. See more about Capital Equipment and Equipment fabrications on the DoResearch website.\nPurchases requiring regulatory compliance, such as: \nHazardous materials\nLab animals\nTransactions that might limit or impact the university\u2019s ability to meet tax-reporting requirements, such as: \nCertain ecommerce purchases\nPurchases from or payments to foreign vendors, which may be blocked by customs departments\nTravel-related purchases: see Guide Memo 5.4.2, Business and Travel expenses\nTransactions where contracts or insurance may be required, such as: \nVenues/facilities for events\nMoving, storage, leasing\n4. Roles and Responsibilities\nIt is the responsibility of the individual incurring the expense(s), those who assist others with incurring expenses and those involved in the preparation and approval of financial transactions to exercise good financial stewardship over university funds, including adhering to all university policies. See detailed description of all roles and responsibilities: Stanford\u2019s Purchasing Card (PCard) Program.\nThe custodian/cardholder is responsible for staying current with all PCard policies and procedures, including seeking assistance prior to making/authorizing a purchase if there are questions.

These best practices help mitigate fraud, waste, and abuse and support financial stewardship excellence for the university. The quarterly clearing process, managed by Stanford Financial Management Services (FMS), represents an additional control in this process, ensuring that transactions are cleared and identified for management review and further reinforces the department-level activities. The quarterly clearing process is based on fiscal quarters within the fiscal year.\nStanford\u2019s policy for Travel Cards and Purchasing Cards requires transactions to be verified and approved within 60 days of the completion of travel (for TCards) or the SU Credit Card Posted Date (for PCards). Advances must be cleared or returned within 60 days of their expected clearing date.\nFMS will force clear transactions aged beyond 60 days to the card\u2019s guarantee PTA (for PCards and TCards) or to the org\u2019s AP Default Account (for advances). Budget units will be charged $35 for each transaction that is force cleared. For current fiscal year deadlines and reminder dates, see the aging transactions clearing deadlines below.\nWhen an expense is force cleared, it is still critical to create and store supporting documentation for audit per Admin Guide 3.1.5 Retention of Financial Records as well as move charges to an appropriate PTA and expenditure type if the force clear PTAE was not appropriate.\nIndividual PCards or Travel Cards with transactions that are force cleared in two different quarters within a 12 month period may be suspended for 60 days. Learn more on the Purchasing Card and Travel Card policy pages.\nFor more information on viewing, monitoring, and clearing aging transactions, and responding to force cleared transactions, visit Topic Overview: Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/research-policy-handbook-export-controls-applicability-and-policy", "text": "Applicability and Policy Background, and Regulatory Authority\nDefines requirements for exports of research-related items, information and software code; addresses policies on acceptance of 3rd party export controlled items and data; describes documentation requirements for export control determinations including export license exceptions and exclusions; and establishes compliance with trade sanctions laws as an integral export control policy function.\n1. Applicability\nThis policy addresses issues related to:\nshipping tangible items overseas\nsharing confidential technical information or software source code with foreign nationals wherever located\ninteractions with embargoed or sanctioned countries, organizations, or individuals\nFederal regulations related to these topics are complex and changing. Individuals at Stanford are therefore encouraged to contact Stanford's Export Control Office whenever they expect to be involved with any of these issues.\n2. Policy Background\nExport controls, set forth in regulations administered by several federal agencies, impose access, dissemination, and participation restrictions on the transfer of \"export controlled\" software code and information and on the export and reexport of tangible items. An export is defined as the shipment of tangible items and the transmission or transfer of software code or information to another country, while a \"deemed export\" is the disclosure of controlled software code or information to foreign nationals in the US. The US Commerce Department must issue an export license or authorize an exception to or exclusion from license requirements before any controlled tangible item, software or information in the US on the Commerce Control List (CCL) may be exported or reexported. Likewise, if a tangible item, software or information is on the US Munitions List (USML), the US State Department must issue an export license or authorize an exception to or exclusion from licensing requirements. Stanford University will comply with all applicable export controls, as established by federal regulations.\nExport controls restricting a foreign national's participation in university research within the United States, i.e., \"deemed export\" restrictions, generally do not apply to the conduct or results of fundamental research (for more information, see PDF entitled \"Reminder -Export Control Requirements\" available below in \"Related Items\") . Stanford conducts only fundamental research as defined by the export control regulations - namely, openly-conducted basic and applied research in science and engineering that is not subject to access, dissemination, or participation restrictions (see Openness in Research policy). Because fundamental research is excluded from export control regulations, research, and other scholarly activities involving foreign nationals at Stanford do not trigger the need to obtain export licenses before they may proceed.\nOf primary concern are transactions involving proprietary or confidential export-controlled information provided to Stanford researchers by third parties, such as corporate vendors, subcontractors, or government collaborators. These may generate disclosure restrictions that may only be acceptable if they fall within the narrow exceptions provided by the Openness in Research Policy and qualify for treatment under an exemption (ITAR) or license exception (EAR) in the export control regulations (see \"Accepting a Third Party Party's Controlled Items or Data\").\nIn the case of international shipments of tangible items, or the export or deemed export of 3rd party export controlled software code or information to foreign countries or their nationals , Stanford has the responsibility to either:\nObtain an export license\nDocument an express determination that an exception to export licensing requirements applies\nDocument an express determination that no license is needed\nFor detailed guidance on the Stanford community\u2019s responsibilities under University and Federal export control policy, see the Reference Guides available in the Documents tab of the \u201cRelated Items\u201d below.\n3. Regulatory Authority\nA. International Traffic in Arms Regulations 22 CFR 120-130\nThe US Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), is responsible for items and information inherently military in design, purpose, or use. Referred to as \"defense articles,\" such items are found on the US Munitions List, 22 CFR 121. Certain spacecraft and satellites, even if not for military use, are on the Munitions List, along with their associated systems and related equipment. Information related to Defense Articles is referred to as \"technical data.\"\nB. Export Administration Regulations 15 CFR 700-799\nThe US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), has export jurisdiction over everything in the United States, although BIS does not require a license for every export. BIS controls goods and information having both civilian and military uses by including them on the Commerce Control List, 15 CFR 774, also known as the \"Dual Use List.\" BIS uses the term \"technology\" when referring to information about the goods on the Commerce Control List.\nC. Office of Foreign Assets Control CFR 500-599\nThe US Department of the Treasury oversees US economic sanctions and embargoes through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Empowered by the Trading with the Enemy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, OFAC enforces trade, anti-terrorism, narcotics, human rights and other national security and foreign policy based sanctions prohibiting the provision of anything of value, either tangible or intangible, to sanctioned countries, organizations, or individuals. OFAC has broad authority to license block or otherwise regulate \"transactions\" involving goods, technology and services to restricted destinations or parties.\nCurrent Version: 09.20.06 \nOriginal Version: 09.17.04"}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/administrative-guide-memo-543-travel-cards", "text": "5.4.3 Travel Cards | Administrative Guide\nThis Guide Memo contains policies on the use of Stanford Travel Cards (TCards) to pay university travel costs. This policy establishes the rules and guidelines for the appropriate use of the Stanford-issued Travel Card. It applies to all Stanford University employees and departments applying for or holding a Stanford-issued Travel Card. This policy is based on and in alignment with the expectations set forth by Administrative Guide Memo 1.1.1: Code of Conduct, specifically with regard to employing sound business practices and exercising prudent financial management in the stewardship of university resources. For detailed guidance and supporting resources, see the Stanford Travel Card (TCard) Program overview on Fingate. The Stanford PCard policy is documented in Administrative Guide Memo 5.3.3: Purchasing Cards.\n1. Purpose\nStanford Travel Cards (TCards) are university-liability credit cards issued to authorized and trained Stanford employees, who currently have active status on payroll, to pay for travel and travel-related services in support of Stanford University business. Only permissible business travel expenses may be charged to the TCard. The TCard may not be used for personal expenses, except for incidental expenses that cannot be easily separated from a business charge. The cardholder is personally responsible for ensuring payment to Stanford University for any non-reimbursable TCard charges in a timely manner after the completion of travel.\nThe TCard is the recommended payment method for any travel costs not reimbursed through the per diem method. Reimbursing per diem expenses charged to a TCard creates an administrative burden for all parties involved in processing the transaction (i.e., preparer, beneficiary, approvers) due to the steps required to reconcile TCard charges to per diem reimbursement amounts. For more information about purchasing and reimbursement methods, visit the Business and Travel Expense Policies page on Fingate.\nAll TCard transactions must be reviewed and verified in the Expense Requests system and substantiated by adding a detailed and appropriate business purpose for the entire trip and receipts and other supporting documentation. See detailed policy and guidance for the Stanford Travel Card on Fingate and Administrative Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses for university policies.\nThere are two types of TCards: an individual TCard and a Department TCard. The same policies apply for both individual and Department TCards unless specifically noted. The process for the issuance of new cards is defined below in section 2, Eligibility and Authorization to Use a Travel Card.\nThe Individual TCard is issued to and used by a specific individual who is an active Stanford University employee and travels frequently on Stanford business.\nThe Department TCard is issued to an individual who is an active Stanford University employee and is assigned as the cardholder for the department in order to facilitate travel for occasional travelers, students, or non-employees. The cardholder uses the card to arrange and pay for business travel on behalf of the department. The Department TCard must remain in the cardholder\u2019s possession and should not be given to the traveler.\na. Responsibilities\nTravel Card transactions must be expensed within 60 days of completion. If transactions are not expensed within 60 days of completion of travel or the posted date, the expenses may be tax reportable to the traveler or cardholder and may result in card suspension. To clear TCard transactions in a timely manner, an expense report should be completed and submitted within 10 days of completion of travel or the posted date (the date the expense posts to the credit card).\nIf a TCard transaction is not verified and approved within 60 days of the completion of travel, the transaction will be force cleared by Financial Management Services at the end of the next fiscal quarter to the department guarantee account (PTA). Budget units will be charged a fee for each transaction that is force cleared. The department is then responsible for allocating the force cleared transaction, via the iJournals system, to the appropriate account (PTA) and expenditure type. For more information, visit Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions on Fingate.\nb. Verification and Approvals\nTravel Card (TCard) verifiers are individuals who process Travel Card Transactions through the Expense Requests system. Cardholders may also verify their own transactions; however, all Expense Request transactions must route to an approver set up in the Authority Manager system who meets the following criteria:\nHas authority over the account (PTA) charged,\nDoes not report directly or indirectly to the cardholder, and\nIs not the beneficiary of the transaction and does not report, either directly or indirectly, to the beneficiary.\nA detailed description of all roles and responsibilities is available on the Stanford Travel Card (TCard) Program overview on Fingate.\nc. Misuse\nParticipation in the Travel Card (TCard) program is considered a privilege that carries the responsibility to ensure appropriate use and stewardship of university funds. Inappropriate use of the TCard may result in the loss of the privilege, disciplinary action and/or in termination of employment. Fraudulent use may additionally result in criminal prosecution. The cardholder or card user will be held personally liable for all unauthorized charges.\n2. Eligibility and Authorization to use a Travel Card\na. Basic Criteria\nThe Travel Card (TCard) is available to active Stanford University employees. Eligibility is based on a departmentally-determined business need and requires:\nCompletion of an online application providing:\nA guarantee account (PTA)\nThe monthly spending limit for the TCard\nThe individual responsible for verifying TCard transactions\nApprovals from the requesting cardholder's manager or department chair/dean and the appropriate financial approver for the guarantee account (PTA) provided\nCompletion of required online training\nFor more information, see Stanford Travel Card (TCard) Program on Fingate.\nb. Delegation of Authority\nIndividuals who have been authorized by their department for Travel Card (TCard) use may charge travel-related business transactions in accordance with the TCard policy details on Fingate. These expenditures must be reasonable and necessary, consistent with established university policies and practices, applicable to the work of the University, including instruction, research, and public service, and must be consistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions. Charges must comply with Business and Travel Expense policy details on Fingate.\nc. Department Responsibility\nDelegation of authority comes with the responsibility to adhere to university policies, including Business and Travel Expense policies and TCard policy details on Fingate. Department management must give careful consideration to who should be provided a Travel Card (TCard) and disseminate any local business rules to users. They should regularly monitor TCard use for compliance. Refer to the information on Fingate on the OBI Dashboard: Expense Requests and SU Card Activity for more information on monitoring TCard activity.\n3. Permissible and Non-Permissible Charges\nCardholders may only use the Travel Card (TCard) for university travel-related business transactions. Individual and department cardholders are responsible for ensuring that all charges comply with policy and are properly itemized, have the appropriate documentation, are supported by a business purpose, approved, and submitted via the Expense Requests expense reporting process.\nGenerally, costs charged to an individual TCard must be for the travel of the cardholder. Costs of transportation (including airfare), lodging or conference registration may be charged to a Department TCard for occasional travelers, including students, groups or university guests.\nTravel Card expenditures must comply with the following:\nExpenditures must be reasonable and necessary. Costs for daily meals, daily lodging, transportation and other incidentals must comply with university policy. This includes airfare tickets, which must comply with class of fare guidance. Refer to AGM 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses for more information and specific travel booking policies.\nWhen charged to sponsored projects, TCard transactions must comply with the sponsoring agency\u2019s policies including allowability and in accordance with the requirements of the Fly America Act and Open Skies Exceptions when using a federal award.\nExpenditures should also comply with any department, school or unit restrictions that may apply.\nThe following list provides examples of travel-related business transactions that are permissible on the TCard:\nLocal and destination transportation, including air, rail, bus, taxi and shuttle.\nRental car and van reservations and gasoline for rental vehicles.\nTravel meals, which are ordinary meals that occur while traveling for Stanford business\nBusiness meals while traveling\nHotel lodging reservations, deposits and/or guarantees\nIncidentals, including phone calls, faxes, hotel parking and internet connectivity\nRegistration fees for non-local and in-person conferences.\nEvent venue deposits, such as for hotels and other facilities.\nThe following list provides examples of travel-related business transactions that are not permissible on the TCard:\nExpenses that are not related to travel. For example, local business meals and local or virtual conference registration (where no travel is involved) should be charged to a Purchasing Card or be processed as a reimbursement.\nLodging or meal expenses when the traveler will request per diem reimbursement for those costs.\n4. Roles and Responsibilities\nIt is the responsibility of the individual incurring the expense(s), those who assist others with incurring expenses and those involved in the preparation and approval of financial transactions to exercise good financial stewardship over university funds, including adhering to all university policies. See a detailed description of all roles and responsibilities for the Stanford Travel Card (TCard) Program on Fingate.\nThe cardholder is responsible for staying current with all TCard policies and procedures, including seeking assistance prior to making/authorizing travel expenditures if there are questions. All roles below should also be familiar with and refer to Administrative Guide Memo 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities as well as the related university resources.\na. TCard roles and responsibilities include:\nIndividual TCard Cardholder: An individual TCard cardholder is an authorized and active Stanford employee and frequent traveler who has a TCard issued in their name to make travel purchases.\nDepartment TCard Cardholder: A department TCard cardholder is an authorized and active Stanford employee who makes travel-related purchases for occasional Stanford travelers and visitors.\nPreparer and Verifier: The preparer is the originator or another individual who prepares and submits expense reports to properly record travel-related expenses and to request payment on behalf of Stanford-authorized travelers. The verifier is the cardholder or another individual who is responsible for reviewing the charges on the TCard Outstanding Transactions tab and immediately reporting or disputing any fraudulent charges to the cardholder. The department is ultimately liable for any unresolved fraudulent or erroneous charges.\nCardholder\u2019s Authorized Manager: The cardholder\u2019s authorized manager is responsible for monitoring the use of the individual and/or Department TCard and assisting with any TCard audits or investigations. The manager is also responsible for notifying Card Services when a cardholder is no longer active, for example, has left the department or is on extended leave.\nFinancial Approver: A financial approver, who must not report to the individual who made the purchase or be the beneficiary on whose behalf the purchase was made, has the responsibilities of the Cardholder\u2019s Authorized Manager; establishes and monitors department-level procedures to ensure that expenses and amounts charged to departmental accounts comply with department and university policy; reviews, examines, approves, or rejects TCard transactions; approves spending limit changes; and uses reporting tools to review recorded transactions.\nDepartments and Unit Finance Managers: Departments and Unit Finance Managers (financial managers, officers and deans) provide oversight of TCards issued in their organization. Budget unit level oversight includes the person granted Expenditure Escalation Authority for the organization.\nCard Services Team: The Card Services Team administers the Card Services program and initiates additional training, suspension of TCard privileges or revocation of the TCard due to recurring incidents of non-compliance with policy or unauthorized charges.\nBusiness Expense Team. The Business Expense Team is responsible for reviewing TCard transactions on an audit basis and communicating non-compliance or unauthorized charges to the department for escalation, approval and resolution.\nb. Audit\nAll Stanford Travel Card (TCard) transactions are subject to additional review by the central Financial Management Services department, as well as by internal and external auditors for financial stewardship including compliance with institutional policies and procedures, and any applicable laws and regulations.\nc. Assistance\nThe Fingate website provides process and procedural information for Travel Card (TCard) holders, verifiers and approvers. See the Stanford Travel Card (TCard) Program, Stanford Travel Card (TCard) policy and Reimbursements and Expense Reports pages.\nThe Financial Support Center (FSC) is available to consult with departments on the application process, training, and use of the Travel Card.\nSee AGM 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities for procedures to follow when a suspicion or discovery of financial irregularities arise, as well as resources to report potentially suspicious activity. \n5. Alternatives to the Travel Card\nAll business travel costs are processed through the Expense Requests System. When a traveler\u2019s personal credit card is used for travel expenses, the traveler, not Stanford, is responsible for any service fees or interest accrued to that personal card. These fees will not be reimbursed. In rare circumstances, a travel cash advance may be obtained if the traveler does not have access to a Travel Card (TCard). Please refer to the overviews of Reimbursements and Expense Reports and Advances for more information on Fingate."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/stanford-purchasing-card-pcard", "text": "Stanford Purchasing Card (PCard)\nIt is the responsibility of the individual incurring expenses, those who assist others with incurring expenses, and those involved in the preparation and approval of financial transactions to exercise good stewardship of university funds and to adhere to university policies. See detailed roles and responsibilities on the Stanford Purchasing Card (PCard) Overview.\nPersonal Charges\nAll PCard purchases must be for the benefit of the university; anything purchased for personal use may be considered a fraudulent transaction and may result in the consequences described in the Cardholder Misuse and Cardholder Fraud sections below.\nPersonal charges are strictly prohibited. If a personal expense is accidentally charged to a PCard, a personal check or money order payable to Stanford University should be obtained from the card user. For details on how to pay back Stanford for accidental personal charges on a PCard and direct the payment to the correct project, task, award, expenditure (PTAE), see How to: Handle Personal Expenses Charged to the PCard.\nRepeated accidental personal purchases will be considered a misuse of the PCard and may result in having Stanford University cardholder privileges revoked. Misuse of the PCard may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\nSpending Limits\nDuring the online application process, the monthly spending limit for the card is established by the department and approved by the financial approver for the guarantee account PTA and by the Card Services team. Changes to spending limits can be requested by submitting a limit change request through the Credit Card Profiles Change Request tool or by submitting a support request.\nCompliance With Expenditure Policies\nPurchasing Card expenditures must comply with, but are not limited to, the following:\nExpenditures must be reasonable and necessary and must comply with university policy.\nPurchasing Card transactions subject to California sales and use tax where tax was not charged at the point of sale may be assessed for tax by Payment Services and Business Expense.\nFor additional guidance, refer to Business and Travel Expense Policies.\nCompliance With Sponsored Project Policies\nCardholders who are allocating expenses to a sponsored project account must be in compliance with their respective sponsoring agency\u2019s policies. For example, Government Unallowable purchases cannot be allocated to a sponsored-project account. For questions regarding sponsored funds, refer to DoResearch: Charging for Administrative and Technical Expenses.\nTimeline for Transaction Processing \nPurchasing Card (PCard) verifiers process PCard transactions through the PCard Module. Processing transactions in a timely manner is important to ensure expenditures are correctly reported. PCard expenses should be verified and approved as soon as practicable after charges are incurred, but no later than 60 days after charges are incurred (the SU Credit Card Posted Date). A reasonable timeframe for verification is within 10 days of the charge appearing in the module.\nCardholders may verify their own transactions but must route transactions to an approver set up in the Authority Manager system who has authority over the account charged, does not report directly or indirectly to the cardholder, and is not the beneficiary of the transaction. A detailed description of all roles and responsibilities is available on the Stanford Purchasing Card Program page.\nFailure to complete verification and approvals within 60 days of the date a transaction is posted may result in card suspension and/or expenditures may be reported as taxable income to the card user or the cardholder. Additionally, if a PCard transaction is outstanding more than 60 days past the date it is posted, the transaction will be force cleared by Financial Management Services to the guarantee PTA. The department is responsible for moving that cleared transaction via the iJournals system to the appropriate PTA and expenditure type.\nEffective with the first force clearing of 2024, an individual\u2019s PCard or TCard may be suspended if a transaction is force cleared by FMS in any two quarters within a 12 month period. View the quarterly deadlines on the Clearing of Aging Transactions Policy page. Learn more about PCard suspension on the Purchasing Card Program page.\nIf an individual PCard\u2019s or TCard\u2019s transactions are force cleared by FMS:\nThe first quarter that this happens, the card custodian/cardholder, their manager, and the finance contact in their school or budget unit will receive a warning notification from the Card Services team via email.\nIf FMS force clears transactions on the same card in another quarter within a rolling 12 month period, the card custodian/cardholder, their manager, and the finance contact in their school or budget unit will receive a suspension notification from the Card Services team via email. The card may be suspended 10 business days after the notification is sent. The card suspension period is 60 days, and reactivation after a suspension for force cleared transactions must be requested and approved. For questions about this process, submit a support request to the Card Services team.\nIf FMS force clears transactions on the same card for a third quarter within a rolling 12 month period, the card may be revoked.\nWarnings and suspensions are tracked by credit card, not by cardholder.\nWhen transactions are force cleared, departments lose the opportunity to assign a business purpose and attach receipts to the transaction in the PCard module, and therefore must store receipts (or explanations for the lack of receipts) locally and ensure they are readily available in case of an audit. To learn more about force clearing, visit Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions.\nDisputing Purchasing Card Charges\nCardholders or the assigned verifier are responsible for promptly disputing any unidentified charges with the merchant first and should try to resolve the dispute. However, if it cannot be resolved with the merchant, only the cardholder can dispute the transaction with JPMorgan Chase, which must occur within 45 days of the posting date of the transaction.\nSince many merchants use centralized clearing houses for credit card processing, the name and location of the merchant on the statement may not initially be recognized by the cardholder. Before disputing any charges, the cardholder should check expenditure records carefully to make certain that the charge is indeed an error.\nDisputed charges must be resolved with the bank no later than 60 days from the date the transaction was posted. The Department is ultimately liable for any fraudulent and erroneous charges not resolved directly with the merchant. See: How to: Dispute PCard Transactions.\nCardholder Misuse\nUsing the PCard for purchases that do not comply with Stanford\u2019s Purchasing Card policy and other university policies and procedures is defined as cardholder misuse. Cardholder misuse will be flagged and audited by Card Services.\nThe consequences of cardholder misuse may include card suspension (including suspension of a Travel Card, if the employee has one), card cancellation, disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the university, and any other potential action identified following a university investigation.\nCardholder Fraud\nCardholder fraud is defined as intentionally using a Purchasing Card for financial or personal gain.\nThe consequences of cardholder fraud may include card suspension (including suspension of a Travel Card, if the employee has one), card cancellation, disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the university, and any other potential action identified following a university investigation.\nAudit and Misuse Investigation\nAs described in Administrative Guide Memo 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities, departments must immediately notify the Office of the Chief Risk Officer or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline of suspected financial irregularities. Individuals wishing to report suspected incidents anonymously may contact the Ethics and Compliance helpline.\nWhen warranted by information obtained during preliminary research, the Office of the Chief Risk Officer will commence a fact-finding investigation into the suspected financial irregularity. The Office of the Chief Risk Officer will plan and coordinate the investigation and will consult with the Office of the General Counsel as appropriate.\nThe consequences of audit investigation may result in card suspension (including suspension of a Travel Card, if the employee has one), card cancellation, disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or other relationships with the university, and any other potential action identified following a university investigation."}

The SDP consists of two parts: The Staff Training Assistance Program (STAP) for job-related or career-enhancing courses and seminars, and the Staff Tuition Reimbursement Program (STRP) providing partial to full tuition payment for individuals enrolled in a degree program. See Educational Assistance Programs for additional information.\n1. Eligibility\nTo be eligible for the Staff Development Program, an employee must meet all the following criteria:\nBe a continuing regular or fixed-term staff employee (including a bargaining unit employee). See Guide Memo 2.2.1 for the definition of regular staff or fixed-term employee.\nReceive no financial assistance from other sources that would duplicate SDP assistance (scholarships, grants, and departmental funds may augment but not duplicate SDP assistance).\nStaff Training Assistance Program (STAP)\nSTAP assistance funds are available to each eligible staff member on the first date of employment.\nAcademic Staff-Teaching: senior lecturers, lecturers, and artists-in-residence who work at least 50% time are also eligible for the Staff Training Assistance Program.\nFaculty, students, temporary employees, retirees, and other non-staff University affiliates are not eligible for STAP assistance.\nStaff Tuition Reimbursement Program (STRP)\nAvailable after an eligible employee has completed one year in a continuing benefits-eligible position at 50% Full Time Equivalent (FTE) or greater.\nThe amount provided is pro-rated if eligible staff works less than full-time, but at least 50% part-time.\nFaculty, students, and other temporary workers are not eligible for STRP assistance.\n2. Staff Training Assistance Program (STAP)\nSTAP assistance may be requested for job-related training, career development, STAP-approved Healthy Living offerings through BeWell, and academic pursuit through the Stanford Continuing Studies Program.\na. Job-Related Training\nTraining must be directly related to performance requirements of the employee's current assignment, and either maintain or improve job skills; be required by law; or respond to organizational or operational need as defined by the employee's supervisor, including training required to respond to organizational or operational need as defined by the employee's supervisor or the university. STAP does not cover training to meet minimum educational requirements of the current job, or qualify the employee for a new trade or business.\nTraining may be a formal course given for academic credit or certificate of completion by an accredited college, university, technical/vocational school or institute, special skills school, or adult education school; a seminar, workshop, or special emphasis short-duration program presented by an approved provider; or training obtained at a conference or professional organization. Online training may be allowable if it meets the requirements outlined in Section 2.a. The employee's supervisor must approve the training in advance. Questions about whether the training or the provider is eligible for STAP should be directed to the Stanford STAP administrator prior to the start of the training course or activity.\n(1) Release Time/Time Off with Pay for Required Training\nAn eligible staff employee's supervisor must approve in advance the course as job-related training and approve the release time, if any, to attend the training. Such time off must be compatible with the work schedule of the department and consistent with requirements of contracts and grants regarding time worked. The department funds time off with pay for training.\n(2) Reimbursement\nRequests for reimbursement of allowable expenses through STAP must be made within 60 days of satisfactory completion of the training, with the supervisor's approval. Submitted requests will be charged against the STAP funds based on the class start date. When employees are reimbursed in advance of course completion, the employee must provide evidence of satisfactory completion to the supervisor. (See Section 5 for the procedure).\nb. Career Development Training\nTraining must be related to an identified and planned training objective for career development. Such training may be a formal course given for academic credit or certificate of completion by an accredited college, university, technical/vocational school or institute, special skills school, or adult education school; or be a seminar, workshop or special emphasis short-duration program presented by an approved provider. Career development must only be for training activities that will assist the employee in qualifying for a new position or advancement within their current trade or business at Stanford. The employee's supervisor must approve in advance this training and any release time needed to attend.\n(1) Release Time/Time Off Without Pay\nAn eligible staff employee may be granted a maximum of 24 hours per month of release time without pay for approved training for career development purposes if no comparable course is offered during non-work hours. Time off for eligible part-time staff should be pro-rated based on the percent time worked. Approval of time off is at the department's discretion and must be compatible with the work schedule of the department and consistent with requirements of contracts and grants regarding time worked.\n(2) Reimbursement\nRequests for reimbursement of allowable expenses through STAP must be made within 60 days of the satisfactory completion of the training with the supervisor's approval.

When employees are reimbursed in advance of course completion, the employee must provide evidence of satisfactory completion to the supervisor (see Section 5 for procedure). For University IT, Healthy Living and Continuing Studies courses, the STAP allowance will be deducted from the fee when employees register for classes.\n3. Staff Tuition Reimbursement Program (STRP)\nEligible employees may request STRP support for courses that fulfill undergraduate or graduate degree requirements at a fully accredited college, university, technical/vocational school or institute, special skills school, or adult education school when the employee is admitted to the degree program (certificate programs excluded). Courses must be taken at, or online through, a regionally-accredited institution recognized by the U.S. Department of Education in order to be eligible for reimbursement. The employee's supervisor must approve the request if release time/time off (with or without pay) is requested.\nCovered degree programs:\nAssociate\nBachelor\nMaster\nDoctoral\nPrograms that are not covered:\nIndividual courses\nCertifications\nGraduate Certificate\nDegree program entrance exams, such as SAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, GMAT, MCAT\nChallenge exams or credit by exam, such as CLEP, UEXCEL and DSST\na. Release Time/Time Off without Pay\nAn eligible staff employee may be granted a maximum of 24 hours per month of release time, without pay, for an approved undergraduate or graduate course, if no comparable course is offered during non-work hours. Time off for part-time regular staff should be pro-rated based on the percent time worked. Approval of time off is at the department's discretion and must be compatible with the work schedule of the department and consistent with requirements of contracts and grants regarding time worked.\nb. Tuition Payment\nPayment of tuition and covered fees through STRP will be made directly to the institution before attendance each quarter or semester.\n4. Allowable Expenses\nAn employee may not receive reimbursement under STAP and reimbursement under STRP for the same course or program. For example, you cannot use STRP for tuition and STAP for books, supplies and equipment for the same course or program.\na. STAP Expenses\nThe current maximum STAP reimbursement is: \n$800 for eligible employees not covered by the SEIU Collective Bargaining Agreement\n$700 for eligible employees covered by the SEIU Collective Bargaining Agreement \n$100 of STAP funds for SEIU-represented staff are reallocated for a leadership, training and educational program, known as the Apprenticeship Program. (For additional information, refer to the 2014 Collective Bargaining Agreement between SEIU Higher Education Workers Local 2007 and The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, Side Letter 7: Leadership, Training and Educational Fund).\nCosts of tuition, registration fees, and required textbooks, CDs, e-books, or tapes are allowable for reimbursement up to a maximum determined each fiscal year.\nTravel expenses, parking, lodging, meals, professional memberships, testing and exam fees, reference books, and professional subscriptions are not allowable.\nb. STRP Expenses\nThe current maximum annual STRP benefit amount is $5,250 granted to the eligible employee at the beginning of each fiscal year. Payments and reimbursements are pro-rated for part-time eligible staff working at least 50% time.\nCovered fees are limited to the cost of tuition, registration fee, lab fees, course fees, and eLearning fees.\nCovered expenses are limited to required books, CDs, DVDs, and other published materials, supplies, and equipment, including software. Supplies, equipment, and software that the employee may keep after the course is completed are not a covered expense.\nAn employee may not use STAP and STRP funds for the same course or program.\n5. Reimbursement\na. Timing of STAP Reimbursement\nRequests for reimbursement of allowable expenses through STAP must be made within 60 days of satisfactory completion of the training, with the approval of the supervisor. Submitted requests will be charged against the STAP funds based on the class start date. Refer to the STAP Frequently Asked Questions for details on the reimbursement process.\nb. Timing of STRP Payment\nPayment of tuition and covered fees will be made directly to the institution by the program administrator before attendance each quarter or semester. If the employee makes payment directly to the institution, the employee must submit the invoice to the program administrator through a Direct Bill request. The program administrator will make payment directly to the institution, and the institution will issue a credit or reimbursement to the employee.\nc. Departmental Reimbursement\nWhen covered costs exceed the current STAP/STRP limit, the excess cost may be partially or fully reimbursed by the employee's department. Departmental reimbursement is at the department's discretion and is determined based on available departmental funds for training. Reimbursement for work-related or career development training may be taxable if the total exceeds $5,250 in one tax year (see Section 7a), regardless of the source of university funds. Departmental reimbursements have the same tax consequences as STAP/STRP reimbursements.\nd. Employee Obligation\nWhen the university reimburses an employee for training costs through STAP prior to completion of the activity, the employee assumes an obligation to complete the supported training in a satisfactory manner. An employee who does not complete university-reimbursed training must repay the university the total amount of the reimbursement.\ne. Evidence of Satisfactory Completion\nEmployees utilizing funds for training expenses through STAP must provide the supervisor with evidence of satisfactory completion as soon as possible\u2014but no later than 60 days after the training activity is completed. For STRP, evidence of satisfactory completion must be provided to both the supervisor (if supervisor approval was required) and to EdAssist, the STRP administration vendor, within 60 days of the course end date. Such evidence may be an official grade card or transcript from the institution or provider of the course. Failure to submit evidence of course completion within 60 days will require the employee to repay the tuition/fee/expense amount to Stanford and could result in the denial of all future requests for tuition assistance. Refer to the STRP Guidelines for details on the Evidence of Satisfactory Completion submission process.\nFor undergraduate academic courses using STRP funds, a grade C or better, or pass grade in a pass/fail course is required. A grade of C- or less will not be accepted as a satisfactory grade.\nFor graduate academic courses, using STRP funds, a grade B or better, or pass in a pass/fail course is required. A grade of B- will not be accepted as a satisfactory grade.\nIf a course may be taken for either a letter grade or a pass/fail grade, the employee must take the course for a letter grade to be eligible for STRP funds for this course.\nf. Repayments\nStaff members who have utilized STRP are required to repay tuition and fees that were paid to STRP to an institution for coursework if: \nEmployee withdraws from a course after the tuition was paid\nEmployee fails to submit proof of satisfactory completion\nFor undergraduate course work, the employee receives a grade of C- or lower or Fail (if a Pass/Fail course)\nFor graduate course work, the employee receives a grade B- or lower or Fail (if a Pass/Fail course)\n6. Application Process\na. STAP\nAn employee planning a training or development activity should discuss development and performance objectives with their supervisor before registering for the course or program. Decisions regarding the applicability of training and issues regarding release time should be made at this time. The employee and the supervisor should review career development plans before registration. No application form is needed.\nDepartmental Review\nThe supervisor should review the staff training assistance request and evidence of satisfactory completion, confirming the following:\nEmployee eligibility (see Section 1)\nProgram applicability (see Section 2 and 3)\nCovered fees and expenses (see Section 4)\nCourse completion (see Section 5)\nHealthy Living offerings or Stanford Continuing Studies Program (CSP) courses are not subject to supervisor approval unless release time is required.\nb. STRP\nThe employee must submit an application for each term (quarter or semester) no earlier than 90 days prior to the start of classes and no later than 30 days after the start of classes. If a supervisor's signature is required for release time/time off with pay, the employee must complete the Supervisor Approval Form. The Supervisor Approval Form can be found and printed from the Stanford My Learning Center website and must be sent to the Stanford STRP office with the employee and supervisor's signature within five business days of application submission. Failure to submit the Supervisor Approval Form will result in a denial of the application.\nPayment of Tuition and Covered Fees\nThe Direct Bill option should be used to request payment of tuition and fees directly to the employee's school by following the four-step application process in My Learning Center, located on the STRP website.\nExpense Reimbursement\nThe Expense Reimbursement option should be used if the employee has paid for tuition and/or allowable fees and or expenses. The employee must make the request and submit documentation as proof of payment within 60 days of the course end date. Detailed information about the application, payment, and reimbursement process can be found on the STRP website.\nc. Tuition & Training Programs Review\nThe Tuition & Training Programs office monitors and periodically audits applications for conformance with standards of eligibility, applicability, and allowability as outlined in this Guide Memo. The Tuition & Training Programs office has final approval over any disputes, of application denial or denial of payment and reimbursements for approved applications. A decision by the Tuition & Training Programs office concerning approval or disapproval of applications, payments, or reimbursements is not subject to review under any grievance procedure. Appeal of a decision by the Tuition & Training Programs office may be made in writing to the Director of Tuition & Training Programs in University Human Resources.\n7. Termination of Employment\na. New Applications\nNo applications will be accepted after employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ends.\nb. Expense Reimbursement\nIf employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ends before a request for reimbursement of covered expenses has been submitted, an employee may submit a manual request for reimbursement if the reason for termination is for any of the following reasons:\nLayoff\nLayoff to Retirement\nRetirement\nMilitary Service\nTransfer from the University to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\nTransfer from SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to the university\nIf employment with the university or SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory ended for any other reason, an employee will not be eligible to request or receive reimbursement for expenses after the date employment ended. However, if an application was submitted and approved, and tuition and fees were paid directly to the employee\u2019s school prior to the date employment ended for any reason, their will not be required to repay that amount.\n8. Tax Implications\nSDP is intended to provide benefits that are, to the extent possible, excluded from taxation under federal and state laws. Accordingly, this Guide Memo constitutes a separate written plan for the exclusive benefit of employees under sections 127 and 132(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations, to provide such employees with educational assistance.\na. General Rule\nIn general, an employee may exclude up to $5,250 received for graduate or undergraduate education under STRP and up to $800 received under STAP from their gross income each tax year for allowable tuition and covered fees and expenses.\nb. Tax Year\nEmployees should note that STRP provides reimbursements of up to $5,250 for each Stanford fiscal year. Because Stanford's fiscal year runs from September 1 through August 31, an employee could be eligible to receive reimbursements in excess of $5,250 for the employee's tax year.\nc. Other Situations\nAmounts paid to an employee in excess of $5,250 may also be excluded if they are payments for certain job-related training, when such training maintains or improves the skills of an employee. However, if the training is necessary for the employee to meet the minimum educational requirements for employment, or if the training will qualify the employee for a new trade or business, the payments will not qualify for this additional exclusion.\nd. Getting Help\nEmployees should consult their personal tax advisor with any questions.\n9. Status and Duration of Staff Development Program\na. Administration\nSDP is administered by the university. The university has the discretionary authority to determine all matters with respect to SDP, including, without limitation, eligibility issues, benefit amounts, evidentiary matters, and tax treatment. Its decisions shall be final and binding on all persons.\nb. Amendment and Termination\nThe university reserves the right to modify SDP in any respect, or to discontinue SDP, at any time."}

Stewardship\nEffective stewardship and accountability of property, both Stanford- and sponsor-owned, are essential. Each member of the Stanford community has a general obligation to safeguard and make appropriate use of property owned by or accountable to the University.\nProperty owned by the University, or for which Stanford is accountable (regardless of ownership) should be protected and secured. Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss, damage, destruction, or theft (LDDT). Incidents of LDDT should be reported to the Risk Management Department and PMO as soon as discovered. In cases of theft, a police report must be filed with the Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS).\nProperty is accountable to designated departments, each of which is responsible for the day to day management, use, care, record-keeping, and disposal of those assets. Shared equipment is accountable to a primary department for purposes of record-keeping\nStanford is one of the largest research universities in the country. Because the federal government and other granting agencies often sponsor funding for research, management of this property has high visibility and may be subject to greater scrutiny and audits. Also, if your department receives donated equipment, there are additional rules and regulations to follow. See Chapter 2.5 for information on how to handle donated property. Accurate recording of all equipment, whether sponsor-funded or not, directly impacts indirect cost recovery requirements and other compliance and reporting requirements.\nAccurate and effective management will benefit individual departments and Stanford as a whole. For assistance, departmental staff should contact their Department Property Administrator (DPA). DPA\u2019s requiring assistance should contact their Campus Support representative in the Property Management Office (PMO).\n3. Title to Equipment\nStanford University has title (ownership), and/or will receive title to all equipment purchased with unrestricted funds, or received as gifts or donations to the University. This includes all equipment located in any Stanford-approved location, any controlled item that is offsite or on loan at other institutions.\nTitle to equipment purchased with funds from a grant or contract will vest according to the terms and conditions of the grant or contract (aka \u201caward\u201d). Unless otherwise specified in the terms and conditions of an award, Stanford generally has title either immediately or at the end of the contract or grant. The Property Management Office clarifies title in cases where it is not clearly stated.\nNO department, departmental unit, or member of the staff or faculty may hold proprietary interest in any piece of Stanford equipment. Regardless of which departmental unit ordered the item, the fund cited, or the budget expensed, the principle of Stanford ownership prevails.\nHaving personally-owned equipment on campus is discouraged. Proof of ownership may be required.\n4. Official Systems of Record\nThe following online systems, working in conjunction with each other, make up the \u201cofficial\u201d property record.\nSunflower Assets (SFA): Used by DPAs and the Property Management Office (PMO) to create and maintain equipment and material.

The Sunflower Assets (SFA) database provides a central information resource where departments and administrative offices can locate a given piece of equipment by searching for an SU.ID tag number, serial number, steward, custodian, etc. SFA and FA form the central, auditable property record for Stanford University; they provide crucial information for the university relative to Stanford capital assets and government or sponsor funded assets.\nAll controlled property must be recorded and tracked in SFA. Departments are also encouraged to use SFA as a single repository for all other property they manage, such as sensitive property, and other non-capital items the department chooses to track. Having a single record facilitates reporting, eliminates redundant and duplicate record entry into unofficial shadow systems, and can be used to track purchase trends within the department. It can also help maximize reutilization to avoid unnecessary purchases, and be used as a tool for replacement planning.\n5.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/policy/property-management-manual-chapter-32-identification", "text": "3.2 Identification | Office of Research Administration\nThe primary purpose of asset identification is to readily identify ownership. By accurately identifying items once they are received, Stanford can better defend rightful ownership should a dispute occur, and can keep track of assets for many purposes including use, availability, stewardship, compliance, tax, depreciation, and insurance. It is essential that all University owned capital equipment, and all sponsor owned equipment, loans and leases be properly identified, tagged with a barcode, and recorded in the Sunflower (SFA) database. \nThe Department Property Administrator (DPA) is responsible to ensure that equipment is correctly identified, tagged, and recorded in a timely manner. Tags and overlays are available from the Property Management Office (PMO) and can be ordered online by visiting the Stanford Property Administrators Resource Center (SPARC). The order form contains a detailed list and description of each tag and overlay.\n1. Key Policy Statements\nUniversity owned capital equipment must be tagged using a Stanford barcode tag and recorded in the Sunflower database within 30 days of receipt. \nSponsor-owned, loaned and leased equipment must be tagged using a Stanford barcode tag and recorded in the Sunflower database within 30 days of receipt. In addition, sponsor identification tags are affixed to equipment when and as required.\nU.S. Government owned equipment must have \u201cU.S. Government Asset\u201d identification strip affixed adjacent to Stanford barcode tag.\nItem Unique Identification (IUID) tags will be affixed in accordance with contractual requirements.\nAdditional department-specific identification may be affixed at the discretion of the accountable department.\n2. Required Identification and Tagging\nThe following property requires Stanford barcode tagging and recording in the Sunflower database:\nAll Stanford-owned capital equipment\nAll Federally owned equipment must also be labeled as US Government Asset.\nAll sponsor-owned equipment for which Stanford is accountable, regardless of cost or location; may include property at a Subcontractor\u2019s facility\nSponsors may require and provide special individual agency tags, which must be affixed in addition to Stanford University tags.\nAll equipment owned by a third party (other than the Federal government) for which Stanford is accountable. Examples include loaned and leased equipment\nAll donated capital equipment\n3. Optional Identification and Tagging\nOptional department identification tags may also be assigned to property, depending on department policies, or requirements. Examples include:\nNon-capital equipment\nItems that departments track for utilization or management purposes\nStanford University barcode tags and overlays are provided by PMO. A sample and description of each tag is available on the Property Tag Order Form on the SPARC website.\nWhen tags are needed, the DPA should submit their order directly to PMO following the instructions at the top of the form.\nWhen the space allows, it is recommended to affix the tag on the equipment so that it directly faces the user and can be conveniently read or scanned without disrupting the item when it is in active use. Care should be taken to not cover manufacturer\u2019s markings. When space on the front of the asset is insufficient, recommended alternative location is the front right side.\n6. Untaggable Assets\nIn some situations, it is not possible or feasible to affix a barcode tag to the equipment due to extremely small size of the equipment/property, inaccessibility, sensitivity or weather/tag deterioration factors. In these instances, the DPA must create an \u201cUntaggable Asset Record\u201d by affixing the barcode tag to a printed copy of the SFA property management database record. This record must be retained by the accountable department and be readily accessible for inventories, audit verifications, etc. \nThe untaggables record file should be periodically reviewed and updated by the DPA to ensure accuracy.\n7. Materials\nIdentification of material inventories or bonded storeroom operations is done in accordance with contract terms or specific project needs. Contact your Property Programs Manager (PPM) for additional guidance.\nSee Chapter 3.3 -Records, for additional information.\nReplacements for barcode tags that are lost or damaged can be obtained from PMO. The SPARC application contains an option for requesting a replacement tag for an existing barcode tag number.\nTypical examples of circumstances where a replacement tag is needed include:\nTag fell off of or was removed from asset\nTag affixed to an asset is damaged or illegible\nTag is removed by a service vendor\nFor replacement of Sponsor provided tags, contact your PPM.\nIdentification tags should remain on the asset for its entire useful life with only a few exceptions. Unless otherwise directed by PMO, the DPA should only remove property identification tags when an item is:\nReturned to the manufacturer for replacement\nUsed as a trade-in towards another purchase\nReturned to the sponsor or other third-party owner\nWhen specifically instructed by PMO\nAdditionally the US Government Asset label should be removed as directed by PMO, upon receipt of approval to transfer ownership of Government property to Stanford."}

If showing a longer period of time, e.g., years, it is best to select broader time periods like GL Period Fiscal year since there would be so many GL Period Name values.\nFund Trend Graph for SU Set of Books by balance \nThe GL Balance Trend Graph for SU Set of Books shows balance amounts for beginning balance, fund balance and available balance. The fund balance for one period carries forward to become the beginning balance for the next period. The available balance is the fund balance adjusted for accrued assets and liabilities, e.g., the fund balance could be reduced by uncleared advances, but the available balance amount does not carry forward to the next period but is instead calculated based on current accruals.\nFund Trend Graph for SU Set of Books by activity \nThe GL Activity Trend Graph for SU Set of Books shows the trend for things that affect the balance, such as expenses and receipts.

The Net Investment value is always a negative amount equal to the fund balance so that the sum, or available balance, will be zero. Drilling on a data point reveals underlying details and is useful for researching values.\nFund Trend Graph for EN Set of Books by activity stacked \nThe GL Activity Trend Chart for EN Set of Books shows the trend in a stacked format to highlight positive and negative influences on the balance and show the net activity amount in the form of a line graph whose scale is shown on the right side of the graph, with generally smaller values than the stacked scale on the left side.

The cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean, or designee should establish guidelines to ensure consistent application of this policy across their business unit. This policy is based on and in alignment with the expectations set forth by AGM 1.1.1: University Code of Conduct, specifically regarding employing sound business practices and exercising prudent financial management in the stewardship of university resources.\nApplicability:\nThis policy applies to all faculty, academic staff, and regular staff as defined in Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions.\n1. Policy Statement\nSchools, departments, and other organizational units (business units) may use appropriate university funding sources to occasionally provide gifts, awards, or prizes to university employees to recognize non-performance-related activities. See Cardinal at Work for information on performance recognition. Each business unit decides who is eligible and what occasion warrants a gift. The cognizant vice president, vice provost, dean, or designee should establish guidelines to ensure consistent application of this policy across their business unit. Gifts may not be presented in place of payment for services. All gifts, awards, or prizes given to university employees are taxable income to the employee except for the following, and then only when given within the parameters detailed in the subsequent sections:\nTangible length of service/retirement awards\n\u2018De Minimis\u2019 tangible gifts, awards, prizes, and sympathy gifts as defined in Section 3\nCash or cash equivalent items, which include all gift cards and gift certificates, are always taxable to the recipient regardless of the amount as required by IRS regulations.\n2. Tangible Length of Service/Retirement Awards\nA regular staff employee and an academic staff employee must be in active service on their anniversary date to receive the length-of-service award. Length of service is determined by computing the period of service as defined in Guide Memo 2.1.6: Vacations, Section 1.a. The value of the award should be proportionate to the number of years of service recognized (e.g., a 15-year service award is greater than the 10-year service award). Recognition should be made in five-year increments. \nTo commemorate length of service or retirement, an item or items of tangible personal property with a total value up to $400 can be given on a tax-free basis to an employee with at least five years of service. The value or cost of the length of service or retirement award should not exceed $400 during the taxable (calendar) year.Stanford-branded merchandise or other tangible items, including food, are recommended. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are taxable to the employee regardless of the amount. Learn more about employee gifts on Fingate\u2019s Categories of Purchases.\nThe value of the award should be proportionate to the number of years of service recognized (e.g., a 15-year service award is greater than the 10-year service award). The award must be presented in a meaningful presentation or ceremony. Every attempt should be made to give a length of service/retirement award during the year the anniversary occurs. Business units must ensure that special presentation events are conducted only on an occasional basis and that the costs of these events are reasonable. Recognition should be made in five-year increments.\nIf the employee elects to retire the same year they become eligible for a length-of-service award, then the maximum total value or cost of the award(s) should not exceed $400 for the award(s) to be nontaxable. \nThe guidelines above also apply to faculty retirement awards. Faculty members do not participate in the five-year incremental length of service awards or the Stanford Celebrates You program.\nLength of service or retirement awards with a value over $400 will be taxable to the extent the value exceeds the dollar limit (e.g., if a $450 award is given, then $50 will be taxable).\n3. \u2018De Minimis\u2019 Tangible Gifts, Awards, Prizes, and Sympathy Gifts\na. Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nTangible items of personal property given to an employee as a gift, award or prize should not exceed an aggregate value over the course of a calendar year of more than $100 per individual. Gifts, awards, or prizes that are provided frequently to an employee, even in small amounts, are not considered de minimis. Stanford-branded merchandise or other tangible items, including food, are recommended. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are taxable to the employee regardless of the amount.\nDonated prizes or gifts used for a raffle drawing or door prize at an employee event must comply with the $100 per individual limit for the prize to be non-taxable to the employee.\nGifts with an aggregate value over $100 will be fully taxable (e.g., if several gifts which total to $150 are given over the course of a calendar year, then $150 will be taxable).\nb. Sympathy Gifts\nTangible items of personal property, such as flowers or fruit baskets, may be given to an employee to express sympathy when there is a death or serious illness of the employee\u2019s close family member. The value of the gift should not exceed an aggregate value of $100. Any gifts of cash or cash equivalents, gift cards, or gift certificates are taxable to the employee regardless of the amount.\n4. Requesting Payment and Recording Value\nThe value of a gift, award, or prize may be paid personally and reimbursed by the university or purchased using a university Purchasing Card.\na. Non-taxable Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nThe employee\u2019s name and the occasion for the gift (e.g., 10-year service) must be included in the transaction. \nb. Taxable Gifts, Awards, and Prizes\nThe employee\u2019s name, employee ID number, and occasion for the gift must be included in the transaction to allow for the value to be tax reported to the employee on their Form W-2.\n5. Employee Morale and Performance-based Awards\nThis policy does not discuss ordinary business expenses in the promotion of employee morale. Examples of such business expenses are occasional business lunches or office gatherings. For more information, see Administrative Guide Memo 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses.\nThis policy does not discuss performance-based awards or bonuses, which are taxable to the recipient and processed through Payroll.\n6.

At a minimum, the process includes a physical sighting or other approved method of verification to confirm the existence, location, department, project accountability, and use status of equipment.\nIn general, inventory results are indicators of the overall effectiveness and level of compliance with property management processes and controls. Inventory results confirm the accuracy of the property records and are used as the basis for financial, stewardship, and compliance reporting. Results confirm what may be considered as a best practice or may be used to identify areas of potential improvement.\n1. Key Policy Statements\nA campus-wide inventory is performed on a biennial basis; more frequent inventory events may occur depending on the terms and conditions of the accountable sponsored project or other identified risk.\nAsset accountability is at the department level, with additional stewardship responsibilities at the custodian or user level.\nTo ensure separation of duties, the primary inventory verification is performed by the Property Management Office (PMO), with reconciliation of exceptions done by departments.\nThe Sunflower (SFA) database is used as the data source and system of record for equipment for physical inventory activity.\n2. Inventory Performance Goal\nDepartments are required to meet a performance goal of 98% (100% for sponsor owned) which conforms to current industry standards for property management.\nDepartments not meeting inventory performance goals may be required to submit a corrective action plan to PMO.\n3. Inventory Frequency\nA biennial physical inventory is performed on a cyclical basis at Stanford. Circumstances which may warrant more frequent inventories include:\nAward close-out or termination\nTerms and conditions of a sponsored project\nResults of a prior inventory\nChanges in level of departmental compliance\nLarge organizational changes\nEmergency response or support\nOther identified risks\n4. Inventory Baseline\nAt a minimum, the assets included in an inventory baseline are comprised of the following asset groupings for which the University is responsible and accountable, regardless of their physical location:\nStanford-owned capital assets\nGovernment or other Sponsor-owned equipment and material (regardless of cost)\nLeased equipment\nEquipment on loan to the University\nDesignated sensitive property\nOther assets, such as Stanford-owned non-capital equipment, may be identified and recorded in the SFA property management database. Such assets, if encountered during the verification process, may be scanned but are not included in the baseline results of the biennial inventory.\nSpecial inventories are performed as needed. Assets included in the baseline for a particular event will be based on the circumstances leading to the requirement for performing the inventory.\n5. Physical Inventory Planning, Preparation and Scheduling\nPMO is responsible for the development and implementation of the biennial inventory schedule. Prior to each inventory, communications occur with each department involved to confirm details including:\nSchedule\nKey personnel\nArea escorts and access\nAsset baseline\nSpace to be included in walkthrough\nVerification and reconciliation expectations\nDocumentation requirements\nInventory event communications\nReporting resources\nAdditional considerations as needed\nCritical factors contributing to the success of an inventory include:\nVisible management advocacy of property administration requirements\nDepartment-wide understanding of property management processes and performance goals\nTimely and effective interaction with the Department Property Administrator (DPA) by all personnel\nAccurate and timely record-keeping by DPA\nCompletion of the steps included in the Pre-Inventory Checklist\nInventory Schedule Changes\nThe Biennial Physical Inventory schedule is developed by PMO in collaboration with the designated Department Property Administrator (DPA). \nA primary objective in scheduling is to maintain approximately a 2-year interval between inventory events for a given area/department; however, we strive to support the needs and availability of departmental staff. Should a schedule change be required, please contact your Property Programs Manager (PPM) or the Inventory Specialists in PMO.\n6. Key Roles and Responsibilities\nProperty Management Office \nEstablish policy, procedure, performance criteria, and process implementation\nDefine inventory schedule\nConduct initial scanning event\nProvide interim, reconciliation and final reports \nReview, approve, and post inventory adjustments\nDepartment Management\nEnsure adequate resources are available to support inventory event\nDisseminate inventory information to maximize staff participation\nSupport ongoing property management awareness and compliance\nPrincipal Investigator (For equipment accountable to sponsored projects)\nEnsure assets are accessible for inventory verification\nMaintain ongoing communication with the DPA regarding property activities and record updates\nAssist in subcontractor communication, as needed\nProvide assistance to DPA during reconciliation\nDepartment Property Administrator \nEnsure property is tagged and records are current, complete, and accurate\nProvide adequate escort and access during scanning and reconciliation activities\nProvide documentation for untaggable and off-campus assets, including those in storage\nResearch and provide resolution for unfound assets within reconciliation period\nAsset Custodian\nAssist the DPA as needed during inventory scanning and the reconciliation periods\n7. Verification and Data Collection\nMethodology\nThe majority of assets are verified during the inventory via one of the following three methods:\nWall to wall physical verification \nSearching each room of a building for all recorded assets within\nInventory by exception \nSubstantiating asset via pre-defined alternate method (e.g. maintenance or calibration record, transfer documents, network pinging report)\nAttestation with sample verification \nUsed primarily in low volume or low risk areas\nSelecting and physically verifying a random sample from a listing which an authorized department representative provided as confirmation of inventory\nWall to wall verification is the primary method used for physical inventory. Inventory by exception and sample inventories may be used for special situations and require the prior approval of the Director of the Property Management Office.\nTechnology/Data Gathering\nFor the majority of assets, barcode technology is used to record the equipment location and verify the following data elements:\nStanford ID number (SU barcode number)\nDescription\nLocation\nManufacturer Name\nModel Number\nSerial Number\nGeneral Use Status\nGeneral Asset Condition\nOther data elements as needed or specified in the biennial inventory plan\nEach asset physically verified during the inventory is marked with an inventory decal identifying the current inventory cycle. Missing or damaged ID tags may be identified and replaced as needed.\nThe Sunflower database is updated to correct inaccurate data, which is discovered during the physical inventory scanning and verification process.\nAsset Record History\nThe Sunflower asset record for each item included in an inventory baseline has an inventory event recorded in its transaction summary and history. The posting will include an inventory resolution type and date.\n8. Special Circumstances\nIn addition to the verification methods stated above, the following special circumstances may require alternate inventory protocols:\nUntaggable Assets\nUntaggable assets (As defined in Chapter 3.2\u2013 Identification) are to be fully inventoried in conjunction with the initial scanning event for the area in question.\nDepartment Property Administrators (DPA's) are expected to provide the Inventory team with current copies of the required supporting documentation (e.g. \u201cUntaggable Binder\u201d) for all untaggable assets in their department(s), and identify them during the wall to wall scan.\nOff\u2013Campus Assets\nAssets may be located off-campus and inaccessible for physical verification. Such circumstances include:\nItems in use at a subcontractor facility\nItems approved for use at a residential location of a University employee\nItems in use at an alternate business/work location\nItems out for repair\nGenerally, for verification of an item that is inaccessible due to an off-campus location, the DPA is expected to provide the Inventory Group with a copy of a current (updated within the last 12 months) Off Campus Equipment Verification Form. This document serves to verify the current asset status. Periodically, the custodian may be required to return the item(s) to campus for physical verification.\nGovernment Owned or Furnished Property at Subcontractor Facility\nGovernment-owned or Government furnished equipment at a subcontractor\u2019s facility for which Stanford is accountable may have specific inventory requirements per the terms and conditions of the accountable award. PMO will work closely with the PI and the subcontractor to ensure the inventory is completed, reconciled, and reported.\nItems in Storage\nStored equipment may or may not be located on campus. Items in storage on campus can usually be inventoried during the wall to wall physical scanning and verification of a department\u2019s assets. On-campus assets that are inaccessible (i.e. packed or crated) should have an accompanying listing verifying the contents of each storage container for use as an attestation. A sample verification may be performed as needed.\nEquipment stored off campus should be documented as an off campus asset, and inventoried as such. Refer to Chapter 3.5, Use and Maintenance regarding the proper documentation and accounting for equipment stored off-campus.\nCannibalized Assets\nCannibalized assets should be immediately identified as such and the DPA informed. PMO approval should be requested for the record to be retired from active status. Record updates are processed centrally, by the Property Programs Manager.\nFabrications - Work in Process\nUntil completed, fabrications are not considered capital equipment; they are construction-in-process (CIP). This includes components that exceed the capital threshold, which have been clearly identified as fabrication components. Unless otherwise specified in the agreement terms and conditions, CIP is not included in the biennial physical inventory. \n9. Material Inventories\nMaterial that is Government-owned or Furnished (GFM) and is accountable to a sponsored project is inventoried biennially and/or per the terms and conditions of the sponsored award.\nMaterial items are not individually bar coded. Quantities are verified in a method appropriate to the type of material. The inventory of GFM is limited to the balance on hand items.\n10. Reconciliation and Reporting\nReconciliation Period\nThe reconciliation period begins after the initial wall to wall scanning event of an area by the PMO inventory team. Preliminary reports are provided to the DPA, usually within 5 working days. They identify items still to be located.\nReconciliation periods vary based on the number of assets in a department. The specific timeframe will be communicated to the department prior to the start of the inventory. Departments should plan to have personnel available through the completion of the inventory and reconciliation to identify, locate, or otherwise account for unfound equipment. As unfound items are located, the DPA should contact the Inventory team to arrange for the items to be scanned, or provide photographic evidence of the asset. Documenting extraordinary circumstances in lieu of one of these two actions requires approval from the appropriate Property Programs Manager (PPM) in order to resolve the inventory discrepancy.\nInterim Reporting\nDuring a department\u2019s reconciliation, periodic reports detailing status results of the inventory will be generated by PMO and sent to the DPA and department management, as applicable.\nCorrective Actions\nDepartments not meeting the inventory performance goals may be required to submit a corrective action plan, outlining in detail the steps they will take to improve performance in subsequent cycles going forward. Failure by a department to successfully meet the inventory performance goal may also result in a department\u2019s physical inventory being performed more frequently than every two years.\n11. Final Reporting and Financial Adjustments\nAt the conclusion of the two-year cycle, items not located will be declared unaccounted in the SFA database. Overall University results are analyzed and final reports generated. Inventory results of government-owned property are provided to the cognizant sponsor representatives per the terms of each accountable agreement. \nShould Government-owned assets remain unaccounted at the conclusion of the inventory period the Sponsor will be notified. A corrective action plan is submitted with a request for relief of accountability in compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) regulations and terms and conditions of the award. If a Government-owned asset reported as unfound is later located, the sponsor will be notified and the property record reactivated. Adjustments to the property record will be made in accordance with Sponsor directives.\nNon-federal Sponsor-owned assets not located during the inventory cycle are reported to the Sponsor as required by the terms and conditions of the award.\nStanford-owned items not located for two consecutive cycles will be evaluated for potential write-off. Financial adjustments are recorded in the SFA and Oracle Fixed Asset systems.\n12. Special Inventories\nLocation Updates\nLocation inventories are usually independent of the biennial physical inventory. Moves of equipment into or out of labs, administrative areas, etc. necessitate updating the location information in the SFA database. For large moves, a \u201cLocation Inventory\u201d is an expeditious method to update the records with the new location. This will help to ensure that equipment affected by the move has been accounted for.\nContact your Property Programs Manager to arrange a location inventory.\nContract Closeout\nA final physical inventory of the equipment accountable to a sponsored award and, associated subawards, is often required as part of the contract closeout process. These inventories are conducted on an award by award basis at the end of the award period, or as required by the terms and conditions of the sponsoring agency. All accountable property, regardless of location, must be included. The results are reported to the sponsoring agency as specified by the terms of the award.\nContract Terminations\nPer Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 52.245-1.f. (iv), a complete inventory of equipment or material accountable to the contract is usually required if a contract is terminated before the end of the performance period. Contract terminations are time-sensitive. Contact PMO as soon as the issue arises. \nSubcontracts\nGovernment-owned property at sub-contractor facilities, for which Stanford University is ultimately accountable, is also subject to physical inventory. Sub-contractor physical inventories are performed biennially or as required by the terms and conditions of the sponsored award. The subcontractor provides signed attestation as to the accountable property in their possession. The attestation information is subsequently reported by PMO to the Sponsor as required."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/policy/administrative-guide-321-responsibility-university-funds-section-3-review-and", "text": "3.2.1 Responsibility for University Funds\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 36\nThis Guide Memo describes responsibilities for the management of funds in University Projects, Tasks and Awards (PTAs).\n1. Responsibility for University Funds\na. University Officers' Responsibility\nDeans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators, and other University officials are responsible for the management of funds in their PTAs. See Guide Memo 1.2.1: University Organization. These individuals have the authority to expend these funds to accomplish their assigned responsibilities, and are responsible for assuring that expenditures charged to their PTAs are:\nReasonable and necessary\nConsistent with established University policies and practices applicable to the work of the University, including instruction, research, and public service\nConsistent with sponsor or donor expenditure restrictions\nFor more information on cost policy, see Guide Memo 3.1.4: Cost Policy.\nb. Delegation of Authority\nAuthority to sign expenditure documents for the purchase of services and materials on a PTA may be delegated and the University official may authorize the person to whom authority is delegated to further delegate signature authority. The University official retains accountability for prudent control of the PTA. The University official may place limits on the dollar level and the types of expenditures for which signature authority is delegated. For more information on authorization procedures, review and error correction procedures, and expenditures of restricted funds, please see the Financial Authority section of the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n2. Authorization Procedures\na. Authority and Required Training\nEmployees responsible for reviewing and approving expenditure transactions must be granted financial approval authority in Authority Manager and complete required training. Training covers all key responsibilities of financial transaction approvers, including expectations relative to sponsored projects. For more information, see Financial Transaction Approval on Stanford\u2019s Gateway to Financial Activities website.\nb. Delegation of Signature Authority\n(1) University Officials\nA letter from University officials indicating the organization for which they are responsible and the administrator to whom they have delegated the ability to manage authority must be on file with Financial Management Services.\n(2) Delegation of Signature Authority\nTo delegate authority for both electronic and paper form transactions, the person responsible for the organization or PTA must delegate such authority via the Authority Manager.\nc. Electronic Signature\nUsers of campus financial systems identify themselves to these systems using approved, secure authentication methods. See Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems, for details on these methods. In addition to these system-independent authentication methods, financial systems may have system-specific authentication methods (e.g., a username and password for a particular system). Regardless of the authentication method, authentication using any of the approved methods is the electronic equivalent of an employee's hand-written signature and may be used as an \"electronic signature\" in electronic applications.\nd. Signature Security\nOnly the person to whom authority is delegated may authorize a transaction either manually or electronically. Disciplinary steps will be taken against individuals who are found to have fraudulently signed the name of another person, used the authentication information of another person, or divulged their authentication information to another person. The possible disciplinary actions for violations, which can include termination of employment or student status, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. User responsibilities for handling authentication information are described in Guide Memo 6.4.1: Identification and Authentication Systems.\ne. Limitations on Signature Authority\n(1) Expense Reimbursement\nNo person may approve their own expense reimbursement, or the expense reimbursement of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly. Expense reimbursements, which require two signatures, must have the signatures of the person incurring the expense and the person responsible for the management of the PTA or a properly delegated agent.\n(2) Independent Review\nBusiness expenses incurred by or on behalf of the President, the Provost, a direct report to the President or the Provost, or the senior financial officer of the academic units must be approved by an independent reviewer designated by the CFO. Expenses for ordinary supplies, customarily available for all employees in an office, should be approved by a local business official and need not be routed for independent review.\n(3) Salaries\nNo person may sign any payroll/personnel form that affects their own salary, or payroll/personnel forms that affect the salary of an individual to whom their reports either directly or indirectly.\n(4) Conflict of Interest\nNo person may authorize payment to any individual or business where there is a conflict of interest. See Guide Memo 1.5.2: Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest.\nf. Revoking Signature Authority\nThe University official who delegated authority (or the person who currently holds that position) is responsible to ensure granted authority reflects the unit's current needs. When a person with signature authority transfers to another department or leaves the University, their authority is automatically revoked. Changes for other operational reasons can be made at any time through the Authority Manager. For more information, see Quick Steps: Grant, Change, Revoke or Restore Financial Authority to Others on the Gateway to Financial Activities website.\n3. Review and Error Correction\na. Departmental Review\nThe deans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators and other University officials to whom funds are allocated are responsible for reviewing their expense transactions and monthly expenditure/operating statements to assure that:\nAny expenditure is necessary and for University purposes.\nCharges are correct.\nCharges are allowable for the PTA.\nCharges are correctly coded as allowable or unallowable for inclusion in the University's indirect cost rate calculations.\nCharges are allocable to the PTA (i.e., necessary to achieve objectives of the project).\nAny allocation of costs is reasonable and equitable.\nCharges are appropriately documented, and are recorded in a consistent manner within departmental accounts.\nb. Evidence of Review\nReview of transactions is evidenced by a manual or electronic signature in the appropriate field of the form.\nc. Responsibility for Error Correction\nThe department is responsible for correction of errors. Time limits for error correction are outlined in Guide Memo 3.2.2: Cost Transfers, and the Research Policy Handbook 15.3, Cost Sharing Policy. Occasionally errors are found after the regular time limits for correction. Regardless of when the error is found, the University officer whose PTA used the good or service must pay for it, either from the same or another appropriate PTA.\nd. Central Office Review\nTo supplement (but not replace) the University official's basic review responsibility, Financial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Office of Sponsored Research review University selected expense transactions. If incorrect or improper charges are found, the reviewing office directs the person responsible for the expenditures to correct the error. If necessary, the reviewing office may correct the department's error and will provide the department with a copy of the accounting entry.\n4. Expenditures of Restricted Funds\na. Conformity to External Restrictions \u2014 Sponsored Research\nExpenditures of restricted funds, such as organized research or gift funds, whether from federal or non-federal sources, must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the agreement (e.g., grant or cooperative agreement). Expenditures of funds for federally sponsored projects are subject to the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness standards of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR 200, Uniform Guidance), and the negotiated agreements between the University and the federal government. Please see the DoResearch website for more information: http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-administration/major-topics/uniform-guidance-concepts-are-changing Cost-sharing tasks are subject to the same standards as the sponsored project that they support.\nb. Monthly Review of Charges\nFor sponsored projects and related cost-sharing tasks, the expenditure statements must be reviewed each month, as noted in Guide Memo 3.1.3: Expenditure Accounts (PTA). The review should include areas such as those covered by the Monthly Review Guidance and Monthly Reconciliation tools. The review is evidenced by a signature on the monthly expenditure statement. The review must be completed within two months of the end of the month of the statement (e.g., October expenditures must be reviewed no later than December 31). Principal Investigators may delegate monthly review of expenditures, but may not delegate the Quarterly Certification of Charges (see paragraph 4.c).\nc. Quarterly Certification of Charges\nThe following certification of direct costs is preprinted on expenditure statements for sponsored projects and cost-sharing tasks each month:\n\"I have reviewed the three months of expenditures for this quarter. To the best of my knowledge, all expenditures are appropriate. Where required, corrections have been or will be made through the accounting system. I understand that to be considered timely all corrections must be made within two months of the last day of month being reviewed.\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR'S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________ \nPROJECT TASK MANAGER\u2019S\nSignature___________________________Date_____________\"\nQuarterly certification is the responsibility of the project Principal Investigator (or Co-PI). A PI may delegate the monthly review of statements for accuracy, but may not delegate certification of the appropriateness of the charges. This certification statement must be signed by the principal investigator and the project task manager. Only the last expenditure statement for the academic quarter must be signed by the principal investigator and Project Task Manager. The quarterly certification must be completed within two months of the end of the academic quarter being certified, as described in the Monthly Review and Quarterly PI Review Certification. This signature means that the principal investigator has reviewed all direct charges to the project and that either the charges on the expenditure statement are reasonably accurate as shown, or that the appropriate individual in the department has initiated accounting entries to correct any differences. Review and correction of differences must be completed within the deadlines outlined on the DoResearch site.\nd. Record Retention\nThe certified expenditure statements must be retained in the department files for future review by government and University auditors in accordance with University record retention requirements for sponsored projects (see Guide Memo 3.1.5: Retention of Financial Records.\n5. Expenditures of Gifts\na. Conformity to Donor Restrictions \u2014 Gifts\nGifts, which typically differ from sponsored projects in that they do not require a detailed scope of work, budget, or period of performance, may on occasion have restrictions on the use of funds (to ensure the use is consistent with the donor\u2019s original, accepted, stipulations). If this is the case, the University must take care to allocate the funds to the academic area, group, department, faculty member or other University activity as stipulated. While the academic area or faculty member may have broad discretion over the specific expenditures of support, the donor may expect a report on the general uses of funds donated or even a report on line-item expenses. Donors do not typically recoup gift funds, but if a gift made for a restricted purpose has not, however, been spent according to the donor\u2019s restrictions, a donor may have grounds to rescind and recoup the gifted funds.\nb. Gifts to Stanford made by Faculty, Staff, Spouse or Family member\nTo ensure compliance with regulations governing charitable contributions and to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, gifts made to Stanford by Stanford faculty, staff, spouse or family member: \nShould be placed in a unique account so that the source and use of the gifted funds can be clearly identified.\nMay not be placed in accounts under the control of the donor (e.g. neither the donor, nor any individual reporting to the donor, may have signature authority over the account).\nMay not be used to fund travel, purchases, or any other expense that could be construed by others to benefit the donor for purposes unrelated to their work for the University.\nMay not be used to fund the salary of the donor.\n6. Sources for More Information\nCognizant Office\nFinancial Management Services (including Procurement and the Controller's Office) and the Research Financial Compliance and Services (RFCS) office are available to answer questions about expenditure authorization.

Only TCard charges related to the specified expense request will be returned.\nName Selection Criteria:\nSU Credit Card Holder Name is the name printed on the credit card; for department cards, it is the name of the department.\nSU Credit Card Custodian Full Name is the person who has possession of the card. This is most relevant for department cards because they do not have a person\u2019s name on them. For individual cards, the credit card custodian is also the credit card holder.\nPreparer Full Name applies only to TCard transactions and is the person who initially submits the associated expense request for approval. \nVerifier Full Name is the person who is designated as the credit card verifier when the credit card purchase transaction occurs and does not change. This applies to both TCard and PCard transactions.\nCurrent Verifier Full Name is the individual who is currently assigned the verifier role for credit card. This can change when personnel changes are updated using the Credit Card Profile Change Request and is reflected in the Credit Card Custodian report.\nPTA Selection Criteria:\nGuarantee PTA Number is an attribute of the PCard and/or TCard used for a transaction and can be different from the transaction PTA Number. \nFor TCards, it is the PTA where charges are accumulated until they are posted as an expenditure on an expense request.\nFor PCards, it is the PTA to which charges will be force cleared if they are not verified and expensed to a PTA within an appropriate time frame.\nThe Credit Card Transactions - Aging report has two sections based on the type of credit card. It shows credit card transactions that have not been posted to a PTA as an expenditure. Refer to the following screenshots. \nTCard Transactions - Aging & Outstanding\nThe TCard Aging & Outstanding section displays travel card transactions that have either not been applied yet to an expense reimbursement or have been applied to an expense reimbursement that has not been posted to a PTA. This report displays the transaction dollar amounts in buckets, based on their age prior to local approval or the status of their associated expense request while being processed centrally.\nTCard Transactions - Aging & Outstanding - Basic View \nTCard Transactions - Aging & Outstanding - Expanded with PTAE View \nTCard Transactions - Aging & Outstanding - Expanded-Action Needed \nUse the Expanded-Action Needed view to identify TCard transactions that have stalled because the current verifier or SU credit card custodian is no longer active, identified by the relevant Employment or Job Status Indicator column. For TCard transactions on rejected or returned expense requests compare the names of the current verifier and preparer of the expense request. If it is not the same person for both, the expense request and associated TCard transactions will not be visible to the current verifier in Expense Requests to correct and resubmit the expense request. For guidance on how to resolve this, refer to Resource: Resolving Outstanding Expense Requests and Aging Transactions.\nCredit Card Transactions Reports \u2013 PCard - Aging\nThe PCard Transactions Aging section displays all outstanding purchase card transactions, per the selection criteria, throughout their approval workflow utilizing age buckets.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/business-travel-expenses/policy/doresearch-policy-and-procedures-appointment-and-promotion-academic", "text": "Policy and Procedures for Appointment and Promotion: Academic Staff - Research\nEstablishes Stanford policy for Academic Staff - Research (AS-R), including provisions for appointment and promotion, and Visiting AS-R. Clarification added in July 1996 regarding exception to search requirements in the case of recent Stanford doctorate or completed postdoctoral study. In Summer 2016, the designation of Research Associate was changed to Research Scientist, Research Engineer, and Research Scholar.\n1. Introduction\nAcademic Staff - Research (AS-R) are Stanford employees hired to work on Stanford research activities as defined below. As Stanford employees, Academic Staff-Research are subject to all policies and procedures related to Stanford employment, and receive staff benefits, as applicable.\nAppointments made to fulfill a teaching role may be held as a dual appointment with those of research scientist, research engineer or research scholar, or with senior appointments in these categories, when the individual is involved in both education and research activities.\n2. Definitions/Roles\nA. Research Scientist, Research Engineer, Research Scholar\nWorking in a capacity which ordinarily requires a Ph.D. or its equivalent in research skill and subject knowledge, a Research Scientist, Engineer, or Scholar is involved directly in the execution, and frequently the design, of a Principal Investigator's (PI's) research activities. Their primary purpose is to assist the PI in attaining the goals of the PI's sponsored research projects. AS-R may participate in the preparation of proposals, progress, and final reports, and may be the coauthor or sole author of research results, with agreement of the PI. Although not usually engaged in formal classroom teaching, AS-R frequently assist in the guidance of postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students in the laboratory.\nB. Senior Positions: Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer, Senior Research Scholar\nIndividuals whose accomplishments reflect professional achievement and recognition considerably greater than that of a Research Scientist, Research Engineer, or Research Scholar may be appointed as Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer, or Senior Research Scholar, whichever is most appropriate to the nature of the individual's work.\nNote: In Spring 1990, the Faculty Senate Committee on the Professoriate changed the designation of Senior Research Associate to Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer, or Senior Research Scholar. In Summer 2016, the designation of Research Associate was changed to Research Scientist, Research Engineer, or Research Scholar.\nSenior Research Scientists, Senior Research Engineers and Senior Research Scholars may serve as Co-investigators in association with a faculty PI on those research projects (and on related applications for support) for which they carry a significant role. Designation of Co-investigator is not an entitlement; it requires the permission of the PI.\n3. Procedures for Appointment\nA. Selection and Search Procedures\nAs a general rule, an appointment to the AS-R requires a search. Searches are initiated with a written vacancy announcement, such as in relevant professional journals or other publications.\nAll searches must engage actively in affirmative action in the search process; steps may include contacting professional colleagues to solicit names of female and minority candidates (as well as others who would bring diversity to the academic staff) and encouraging such candidates to apply, and contacting resources such as female and minority professional organizations and journals so that such groups are alerted to the search.\nThe text for the announcement must be sent to the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. Advertisements and letters announcing vacancies must include a statement such as:\nStanford is an equal employment opportunity and affirmative action employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Stanford welcomes applications from all who would bring additional dimensions to the University's research mission.\nThe responsibility for affirmative action aspects of the search process rests primarily with the PI.\nExceptions to the search requirement may be permitted if the candidate: (1) has just completed their doctorate or program of postdoctoral study at Stanford and completion of all degree requirements is documented; (2) is uniquely qualified for the particular position; or (3) was previously identified by name on a written research proposal submitted by the PI to an external funding agency.\nB. Criteria for the Appointment to Rank of Research Scientist, Research Engineer, or Research Scholar\nAfter a candidate has been identified and selected for appointment, a recommendation for appointment form through the Faculty and Academic Staff Appointments (FASA) system must be completed, and approved by the Principal Investigator, Department Chair (or Independent Laboratory, Center or Institute Director), the cognizant School Dean, and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research to insure that:\nthe work to be performed is at the level which ordinarily would require a doctoral degree or equivalent research skill and subject knowledge\nthe qualifications of the candidate have undergone careful scrutiny\na serious review has been undertaken of the professional qualifications of a candidate for an AS-R position by others in the field besides the PI\nUniversity-wide equity is being maintained\na thorough affirmative action search has been conducted or, if a search was not conducted, that the requirements for an exception have been met\nRecommendations along with a current Curriculum Vitae must be submitted to the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research prior to the date of anticipated employment. The School Dean's or Laboratory Director's office will be notified of the approved appointment form or if further information or clarification is required prior to approval. Depending on the preference of each School, the Department or School Dean will send written confirmation to the employee indicating the terms, length of employment, identity and duration of funding sources contributing to his or her salary. A copy of this confirmation is sent to the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.\nC. Criteria and Procedures for the Appointment or Promotion to the Rank of Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer or Senior Research Scholar\nAfter a candidate has been identified and selected for appointment to a senior Academic Staff-Research position, a Recommendation for Appointment form through FASA must be completed, approved by the Principal Investigator, the Department Chair (or Independent Laboratory, Center or Institute Director), the cognizant School Dean, and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research, following the same procedure as for AS-R (described in 3.B above).\nIn many cases, individuals are promoted to senior positions from the ranks of Research Scientists, Research Engineers, or Research Scholars. For both appointments and promotions to senior AS-R positions, the Principal Investigator is responsible for submitting the following four items of documentation to the Department Chair for use in review of the candidate:\nAppointment/Promotion Form\nCurriculum Vitae\nWritten evaluations from three referees outside of Stanford who are in positions to judge the professional competence of the candidate.\nCovering memorandum from the Principal Investigator to the Department Chair stating the justification for appointment or promotion to Senior Research Staff.\nSuch appointments must follow a formal review process by a departmental or Independent Laboratory, Center or Institute ad hoc appointment committee consisting of at least two Academic Council members in addition to the faculty Principal Investigator, and, if practicable, a senior member of the AS-R. The ad hoc committee shall review the documentation and prepare a written report to the Department Chair regarding the qualifications of the candidate for appointment or promotion.\nCandidates for the senior position will ordinarily have completed a minimum of five years at the Research Scientist, Engineer, or Scholar rank (or will have equivalent experience). \nSome indicators which may help to evaluate the qualifications of a candidate for the rank of Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer or Senior Research Scholar are the following:\n1. Professional Activities\nIndications of theoretical sophistication and independent research accomplishment, including recent publications, invited presentations of papers at professional meetings, and appointment to review committees in professional societies.\n2. Research Experience\nThe knowledge and ability associated with the rank of Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer or Senior Research Scholar is unlikely to be acquired in less than five years after completion of the Ph.D. or M.D. degree.\n3. Scope of Responsibility\nIn addition to demonstrating depth of knowledge and theoretical understanding which surpasses that generally expected of Research Scientist, Engineer, or Scholar in the field, the candidate for Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer or Senior Research Scholar should be capable of functioning independently at an advanced level in their field under the overall direction of the Principal Investigator. Senior Research staff characteristically should have supervisory responsibility for technical staff. This might include training, guidance in problem definition, performance evaluation or recommendation on salaries, hiring and termination. They may also participate in grant administration, monitoring expenditures, and the drafting of new proposals.\n4. Evaluation by Others in the Field\nCandidates for the rank of Senior Research Scientist, Senior Research Engineer or Senior Research Scholar should have achieved recognition in the scientific community.\n4. Compensation and Terms of Employment\nA. Period of Employment\nA member of the Academic Staff - Research is appointed for a fixed, renewable term of up to five years, contingent on continued programmatic need and funding. Senior Research Scientists, Senior Research Engineers or Senior Research Scholars may be appointed on either a fixed-term or a continuing basis.\nRequests for reappointments of fixed-term appointments must be reviewed at the department level and approved by the School Dean's Office. A written notice of either renewal or non-renewal must be given to the employee at least 90 days in advance of the term end date. The conclusion of a fixed term does not constitute layoff nor is it accompanied by layoff benefits (see discussion below).\nB. Compensation\nAlthough not subject to salary ranges per se, salaries for Academic Staff-Research are subject to the approval of the cognizant Principal Investigator, Department Chair, School Dean and Vice Provost and Dean of Research for purposes of maintaining University-wide equity. Data indicating the distribution of Stanford salaries for each classification of AS-R are supplied to school deans and Independent Laboratory, Institute, and Center directors. This provides a framework from which to review University-wide salaries to insure parity. \nDue to the relatively uncertain nature of financial support for sponsored projects which support Academic Staff-Research members' salaries (whether on fixed terms or continuing appointments), AS-R members shall be informed of the duration of all funding sources which materially contribute to their salaries. This information must be included in the employment confirmation letter and, subsequently, made available to the AS-R member by the PI upon request.\nC. Termination\nAn AS-R member is entitled to 30 days written notice, but not to layoff benefits or reemployment preference, when terminated for unsatisfactory performance or other just cause. In extreme cases of termination for just cause, advance notice of termination may be waived with the approval of the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.\nD. Layoffs\nA layoff (as opposed to end of fixed-term appointment or dismissal for just cause) occurs when a position is eliminated as a result of lack of funds or changing programmatic needs prior to the scheduled end of a fixed-term appointment or at any time during a continuing appointment. If a layoff is a result of lack of available financial support, the AS-R member must be given at least 30 days written notice. Selection of the individual(s) to be laid off is a judgment of the Principal Investigator. These individuals are eligible for layoff benefits and reemployment preference.\nOccasionally, a Principal Investigator chooses to change the direction of their research activities in ways that are not commensurate with the skills or research interests of the AS-R member. When this occurs, layoff is considered on programmatic grounds, not due to lack of available financial support. In these cases, the AS-R member shall always be given at least three months written notice of layoff. They are eligible for the same layoff benefits and reemployment preferences as are applicable for other exempt staff.\nE. Additional Compensation\nWith approval of their faculty supervisor, full-time members of the academic staff may perform a variety of services for the institution apart from those normally considered to be their own regular job duties. Academic staff members may be assigned these tasks either within their department or for another area within the University. Further, it is understood that academic staff may often be expected to work in excess of 40 hours a week. Because the foregoing situations are considered to fall within normal expectations for these staff, they would not constitute grounds for payment of additional compensation.\nAcademic Staff - Research may be eligible for additional compensation when, on a one-time or infrequent basis, they teach in established University programs or University-hosted conferences that: (a) clearly fall outside the boundaries of their regular responsibilities, (b) require a significant amount of time in excess of the normal work schedule and (c) normally provide additional payment to other participants. This exception does not cover appointments to teach regular University courses in degree-granting programs, in which cases salary offsets would be appropriate.\nExamples for which additional compensation might be appropriate include:\nteaching in the Continuing Studies Programs;\nteaching in the Stanford Center for Professional Development;\nteaching in the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Programs;\nteaching in the Postgraduate Medical Education Program;\nteaching in the Graduate School of Business Executive Education Programs;\nteaching in a special event, such as a conference.\nAn academic staff member who teaches in these Stanford programs must be appointed, where relevant, through the regular appointment process of the program. Their compensation for the activity is limited by the established rates for the particular program. AS-R, employed on a full-time basis, owe their primary commitment of time and intellectual energies to the programs on which they are working. The faculty supervisor is responsible for assuring that this activity does not adversely impact that obligation.\nFor activities of the type described above, specific approval for additional compensation is required in advance of the service being performed. Faculty supervisor, the cognizant school Dean and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research must approve all additional compensation involving Academic Staff-Research. Failure to obtain such approval will in all likelihood result in forfeiture of payment.\n5. Right, Privileges and Responsibilities\nA. Academic Staff - Research Members\nAcademic Staff - Research members appointed for terms of six months or longer (at 50% time or more) are entitled to staff benefits available to other regular exempt staff, including vacation and sick leave accrual, with some exceptions related to layoff as outlined above and grievance process, see Academic Staff Grievance Procedure in RPH 10.2.\nWith approval of their faculty sponsor, members of the Academic Staff may engage in outside consulting activities. Permission for members of the AS-R to consult, including the reasons for such permission, must be in writing, normally on a prospective basis, by the faculty principal investigator. Principles that govern outside activities and applicable conflicts of commitment and interest policies can be found at RPH 4.4.\n1. Limitations of Academic Staff - Research Positions\nWhile the highly professional nature of these positions allows PIs to delegate considerable independence and authority to members of the AS-R in support of the PI's research objectives, there are also limitations inherent in these positions. Individuals in the AS-R ranks are not members of the Academic Council; they are not eligible to act as PIs on sponsored projects (Senior Research staff may act as Co-investigators with the permission of the faculty PI, but may not serve as Co-PI); they are not eligible for sabbatical leaves nor in any way are considered to be on a tenure track. Their positions are coterminous with externally-sponsored support and programmatic need. Appointments from the AS-R to the non-tenure line or tenure-line faculty ranks at Stanford may occur, but such promotions are rare and should not be expected as part of an AS-R member's typical path at the University.\n6. Visiting Academic Staff - Research\nA. Definitions/ Roles\nVisiting AS-R and Visiting Senior AS-R positions differ from regular AS-R ranks in that the visitor's primary purpose in coming to the University is to collaborate with the Stanford Principal Investigator on research projects of mutual interest, rather than to provide the ongoing staff assistance normally associated with regular AS-R positions. They also differ from Visiting Scholar positions, which are courtesy appointments without Stanford salary support.\nB. Procedures for Appointment\nVisiting AS-R or Visiting Senior AS-R appointments may be made for periods not to exceed twelve months for individuals who are permanently employed by another institution at a level at least equivalent to the AS-R at Stanford. If the individual ceases to hold a regular position elsewhere prior to or during the Stanford appointment, they are not eligible to continue as a Visiting AS-R. Rather, the person may be recommended for a regular Academic Staff-Research appointment. Formal searches for the visiting appointments are not required as Stanford does not constitute the primary employment commitment to the individual.\nA recommendation for appointment of Visiting AS-R or Visiting Senior AS-R form, accompanied by a resume of the candidate and applicable visa information, must be completed through FASA and approved by the Principal Investigator, Department Chair or Independent Laboratory, Center or Institute Director, the cognizant School Dean, and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.\nC. Compensation and Terms of Employment\nStanford salary support for Visiting AS-R and Visiting Senior AS-R normally is funded from sponsored research projects, typically at a level based on the individual's salary from their home institution. In any event, minimum full-time equivalent salaries for Visiting AS-R and Senior Research staff are established annually by the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.\nD. Rights, Privileges and Responsibilities\nVisiting AS-R and Visiting Senior AS-R are eligible for staff benefits, including vacation and sick leave, if employed at 50% time or more for an anticipated length of six months or more. Regular staff policies for fixed-term appointments apply except that the Academic Staff Grievance Procedures, rather than the staff procedures, are applicable. University courtesies and privileges commensurate with the visitors' rank at their home institutions may be granted by the Provost on an exception basis."}

These might include students at other universities who are engaged in research in a field of interest to a Stanford faculty member or a student who is doing a laboratory rotation as part of a larger research study or grant. Such students are known as Visiting Student Researchers (VSRs) and are appointed as nonmatriculated graduate students.\nWhen agreeing to sponsor a VSR, faculty must be mindful of the need to place primary emphasis on providing research opportunities to regularly matriculated Stanford students. In addition, students sponsored as VSRs must be qualified to conduct research at a level comparable to that of other Stanford graduate students and the research must be of benefit to Stanford as well as the visitor.\nAny Stanford faculty member in any department at Stanford may sponsor a VSR. The sponsoring faculty member and the department chair must sign the letter of invitation and thus assume responsibility for the VSR. The faculty director of an interdisciplinary program or research center or institute that is sponsoring a VSR may sign instead of a department chair. In most instances, faculty members who have appointments in centers or institutes under the Vice Provost and Dean of Research in addition to a department affiliation should sponsor a VSR within their department, since department staff have experience with student enrollments and financials.\nAs current graduate students, VSRs are distinct from Visiting Scholars, whose qualifications state that a person must hold a Ph.D. (or its equivalent from a country other than the United States) or be a recognized expert in the field to be appointed Visiting Scholar.\n2. VSR Sponsorship: Faculty and Department Responsibilities\nSponsorship of a VSR is initiated by the faculty sponsor using the Letter of Invitation for Visiting Student Researchers provided by the Office of the Registrar. The letter template may be modified but must include the information listed on the Inside Student Services website. The letter of invitation must include a description of the research the VSR will conduct and must be signed by both the faculty sponsor and the department chair.\nOnce the student receives the signed letter of invitation, they must submit the required application materials listed in the invitation letter to their sponsoring department. The department is responsible for submitting completed application materials at least 45 days before the anticipated VSR appointment start date, following the process described on the Inside Student Services website.\nBy approving the VSR invitation, the faculty sponsor and department chair ensure that resources to support the VSR, including faculty time, are not being diverted from Stanford students who are matriculated into degree programs. These faculty also assume the responsibility for oversight of the VSR\u2019s research and conduct throughout their appointment at Stanford.\nThe department is responsible for answering any questions the VSR applicant may have about fees, visas, ID, cards, housing, or other issues related to the VSR appointment. The department is also required to notify Graduate Admissions in a timely manner if the VSR does not attend or leaves prior to the appointment end date to ensure fees do not accumulate. The department is also responsible for ensuring that funds used to cover VSR costs (including monthly VSR fee, health insurance, campus health service fee, and/or stipend) are allowable charges.\n3. VSR Appointment and Fees\nAny visiting graduate student who will be participating in research at Stanford for 31 or more days must be appointed into non matriculated student status as a VSR. Any visiting graduate student participating in research at Stanford for 30 days or less is not required to be appointed as a VSR, but has the option of an appointment into this status if the visiting graduate student requires the rights and privileges as outlined in Section 5. VSR Responsibilities and Rights. VSRs will be enrolled by Graduate Admissions in the category: \"Non-Matriculated Graduate Students - Visiting Student Researchers\" (VSR). VSRs are at Stanford to conduct research and are not allowed to enroll in or audit classes.\nIf a department chooses to sponsor a SUnet ID for a VSR before the VSR appointment has been approved and processed by the Office of the Registrar, the department should submit the EmplID number to Graduate Admissions with the completed VSR application to avoid delays caused by duplicate ID numbers.\nVSRs will be charged a monthly VSR fee comparable to Terminal Graduate Registration, set annually by Stanford\u2019s Board of Trustees. VSRs will also be charged the quarterly Campus Health Services Fee, and, unless they document that they have comparable coverage with another carrier, they will be charged for Cardinal Care student health insurance. \nVSRs must remain current in their payments to the University to maintain their VSR status. Persons who are delinquent in their payments will lose their status and, if applicable, their J-1 visa status will be terminated.\nVSR appointments can be for one to twelve months and do not need to begin at the start of an academic quarter. An extension of an original appointment period by one to three months can be requested by the sponsoring faculty, with department chair approval, if the student is in good academic and financial standing with their home university and with Stanford. Graduate Admissions can approve up to a three-month extension. Any subsequent or longer extension requires a statement describing a compelling reason for the extension for review and approval of the Office of the Vice Provost of Graduate Education. \nCitizens of other countries who enter the United States for the purpose of being a VSRs at Stanford must have a DS-2019 (certification for J-1 visa status) issued by the Bechtel International Center prior to their arrival in this country. As part of the DS-2019 process, departments verify that international VSR have sufficient funds to pay required fees and to live in the U.S. Departments retain the evidence of sufficient financial support in their records for at least three years following the end of the J visa program. To maintain their visa, VSRs must have an active VSR appointment throughout the period of their residence at Stanford. The sponsoring department should contact the Bechtel International Center for further information. \nVSRs who have educational loans cannot be certified by Stanford for loan deferments because they are neither matriculated at Stanford nor are they carrying a full-time course load. VSRs should contact their home institution regarding eligibility for loan deferments.\n4. Financial Support of VSRs\nThe host department is not required to provide financial support for the VSR. Funds designated for the support of matriculated Stanford students may not be used to support VSRs. VSRs are not eligible to receive research or teaching assistantships. They may not receive stipends from University scholarships or fellowships.\nIf the department chooses to pay the VSR fees or to provide a stipend for living expenses, payment must be made through the GFS system using unrestricted funds. Additionally, VSRs may be employed on an hourly basis to perform work, including work on a sponsored project assuming that the work is appropriate to the project and funds are available. Hourly job codes are available in the Human Resource Management system specifically for employment of VSRs. VSRs are not subject to working hours restrictions in place for matriculated students. More information about paying students hourly can be found in the university\u2019s Administrative Guide.\nWhen departments provide stipends or pay fees for VSRs, these payments are considered taxable income to the VSR. If the VSR is a non-US resident for tax purposes, and their home country does not have a tax treaty with the United States, Stanford is obligated to withhold or charge 14% federal tax on any of these payments. \n5. VSR Responsibilities and Rights\nVSRs are subject to the rules and regulations required for all Stanford graduate students:\nIntellectual property: VSRs are required to sign a Stanford Patent and Copyright Agreement (known as the SU-18). In special circumstances, VSRs may sign the SU-18A agreement instead of the SU-18. It is the sponsoring faculty\u2019s responsibility to ensure compliance with this university policy.\nThe Honor Code and Fundamental Standard : VSRs who commit violations of Stanford\u2019s academic conduct and behavioral standards are subject to termination of their Stanford appointment. The sponsoring department should inform Graduate Admissions if a VSR appointment is terminated early.\nRequired safety training: the faculty member who sponsors the VSR is responsible to assure that they receive any required training in order to be able to carry out their research at Stanford, including appropriate health and safety training, instruction in the protection of human subjects, or any other instruction required by the work that the student will do here.\nVSRs are entitled to receive a student photo identification card. The card will permit entry and borrowing privileges from the library at the same level as other nonmatriculated students and use of recreational facilities. VSRs will also be eligible to open computer accounts. These services will only be available during the appointment period, provided the student remains in good academic and financial standing at their home institution and at Stanford.\nVSRs are eligible for graduate on- or off-campus subsidized housing, on a space-available basis. VSRs have lower housing priority than students matriculated into a degree program and therefore are unlikely to get on- or off-campus subsidized housing. VSRs are not eligible for other services specified for graduate students enrolled in degree programs, such as the CalTrain Go Pass.\nCurrent Version: 12.13.23 \nOriginal Version: 03.28.96"}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/receipts-gifts/policy/administrative-guide-policy-153-unrelated-business-activity", "text": "1.5.3 Unrelated Business Activity | Administrative Guide\nAuthority\nApproved by the Administrative Council April 1, 1987. It is reissued with approval of the Provost's Office and Controller's Office.\nLast Updated\nDecember 15, 2010 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 15.3\n1. Policy\nStanford's resources exist to support the University's missions of creation, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge. The University's assets must be preserved for these purposes, not for the personal gain of individuals nor for outside parties' uses which do not further Stanford's academic objectives. The University receives frequent requests for access to its resources by outside entities, typically in exchange for some form of compensation to Stanford. Many of these, if granted, would constitute unrelated business activities. The purpose of this statement is to remind the University community that it is Stanford policy not to engage in unrelated business activities.\nUnrelated business activities have the potential for distorting the University's primary teaching and research missions. Furthermore, revenues from such activities generally are taxable under the Internal Revenue Code, and thus carry consequences to the University in terms of income tax liability. They also can have implications for property tax as well as product liability, and they can create unfair competition with the for-profit sector.\nPermission to engage in unrelated business activities at Stanford may be granted only by the Provost, and then only in those cases in which there is strong likelihood that the activity will significantly benefit the University as a whole.\n2. Definition\na. Generation of Revenue\nFor the purpose of this statement, \"unrelated business activities\" are activities that use Stanford resources to generate revenue from third parties, and that are unrelated in a programmatic sense to the teaching, research, and other educational functions of the University. An unrelated activity normally would not be thought to further the University's teaching or research activities, except for the revenue it produces. Because the Internal Revenue Code does not define with precision what activities are unrelated for tax purposes, a general rule of thumb to apply is to assume that any activity undertaken primarily for the revenue it produces is likely to be unrelated.\nb. Support of Mission\nHowever, there are certain activities which might at first appear to be unrelated, but which, under scrutiny, are in fact related in a programmatic sense or provide direct support to Stanford's academic missions. For example, certain services or programs may be conducted on campus for the convenience of University faculty, staff and students, such as food sales at Tresidder.\n3. Implementation and Exceptions\na. Need for Review\nBecause of the necessarily imprecise definition of \"unrelated,\" activities that would generate income and are proposed to be undertaken on behalf of an outside party that involve the use of University lands, buildings or instrumentation or the rendering of services by University personnel must be reviewed in the context of the unit's programmatic mission, Internal Revenue regulations and prior case rulings before they may be approved. Examples include fabrication by University machine shops, testing or analysis of materials, use of University computer facilities and similar activities.\nb. Responsibility\nThe responsibility for implementing this policy rests with line management. If a department chair, director, or dean has any question as to whether a proposed arrangement under their purview might constitute an unrelated business activity, it is their responsibility to have the activity reviewed by the cognizant vice president's office, who in turn may need to seek counsel from the Controller's Office\u2014University Tax Director. Questions arising from departments or schools reporting to the Provost should be directed to the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research.\nc. Exceptions\nIf the cognizant vice president endorses a request for an arrangement that is determined to be an unrelated business activity, the proposal should be forwarded to the Controller's Office for a review of the potential tax consequences, and means of accommodating them, before the request is sent to the Provost for approval."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/receipts-gifts/policy/administrative-guide-policy-141-academic-and-business-relationships-third", "text": "1.4.1 Academic and Business Relationships With Third Parties\nLast Updated\nAugust 11, 2014 \nPrint\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 14\nFrom time to time, the University enters into agreements with various independent entities that may result in an ongoing business or academic relationship with the University. For example, entities with current relationships include Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford Bookstore, Inc., and Stanford Federal Credit Union.\nAlthough these types of entities remain independent from the University, nonetheless, the nature of the relationships makes it desirable to outline how the relationships might be structured. This Guide Memo also provides guidance to University officers, faculty and staff concerning issues that might arise and that need to be addressed prior to entering into such third party agreements.\n1. General Guidelines\na. Potential Issues\nThe agreement between the University and the other entity should make adequate provision for issues that may be called into play by the nature of the proposed relationship. Such issues might include the following:\nPotential property tax or unrelated business income tax imposed on the University\nFailure to appropriately file for a property tax exemption associated with leases of on-campus or off-campus space\nGovernment contract and similar allocation issues\nVicarious liability to the University and indemnities\nIssues relating to public image or government scrutiny\nEffects on legal compliance of University benefit plans\nAll aspects of land use and landowner issues regarding environmental matters\nThe potential for liens or claims against Stanford property or assets\nFraud and abuse issues in the medical area\nEmployment law issues\nPrivate inurement or private use where University assets, income or facilities may be used in a way that benefits or results in profits to private individuals or entities\nUtilities issues\nConflicts of interest\nThe potential triggering of other statutes or governmental regulations\nb. Definition of Relationship\nThe agreement should provide a clear definition of the nature of the relationship and of any responsibilities or obligations undertaken by the parties. The agreement should also address appropriate limitations on those responsibilities or obligations in both time and scope; the defense and indemnification of the University in the event of suit or other adverse action; the need for the University to be named as an additional insured on policies of insurance; the right of the University to review financial records of the entity, where appropriate in light of the relationship; and a date for termination or reevaluation of the agreement and relationship.\nc. Form of Agreement\nA detailed contract will not always be necessary; often a well-drafted business letter agreement may suffice. Whatever form the agreement takes, the other parties need to understand that the University does not seek to intrude inappropriately into the internal affairs of the other parties and in no way is taking on responsibility for their actions\u2014except as to specified actions (if any) for specific reasons that are relevant to the relationship and are clearly delineated in the agreement.\nLand, Buildings and Real Estate (LBRE)/Real Estate department must receive a copy of any lease agreement made with third parties, for consideration of property tax or property tax exemption issues.\n2. Approvals and Consultations\na. Delegated Authority\nThe appropriate office or offices for reviewing and/or approving an agreement will depend upon the areas in which the proposed relationship arises.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/receipts-gifts/policy/administrative-guide-policy-631-information-security", "text": "6.3.1 Information Security | Administrative Guide\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 63\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure the protection of Stanford's information resources from accidental or intentional unauthorized access or damage while also preserving and nurturing the open, information-sharing requirements of its academic culture. This Guide Memo states requirements for the protection of Stanford's information assets.\nApplicability: This policy is applicable to all University students, faculty and staff and to all others granted use of Stanford University information resources. Every user of any of Stanford's information resources has some responsibility toward the protection of those assets; some offices and individuals have very specific responsibilities. This policy refers to all University information resources whether individually-controlled or shared, stand-alone or networked. It applies to all computer and communication facilities owned, leased, operated, or contracted by the University. This includes networking devices, personal digital assistants, telephones, wireless devices, personal computers, workstations, mainframes, minicomputers, and any associated peripherals and software, regardless of whether used for administration, research, teaching or other purposes.\n1. Principles of Information Security\nThe purpose of information security is to protect the information resources of the University from unauthorized access or damage. The underlying principles followed to achieve that objective are:\na. Information Resource Availability\nThe information resources of the University, including the network, the hardware, the software, the facilities, the infrastructure, and any other such resources, are available to support the teaching, learning, research, or administrative roles for which they are designated.\nb. Information Integrity\nThe information used in the pursuit of teaching, learning, research, or administration can be trusted to correctly reflect the reality it represents.\nc. Information Confidentiality\nThe ability to access or modify information is provided only to authorized users for authorized purposes.\nd. Support of Academic Pursuits\nThe requirement to safeguard information resources must be balanced with the need to support the pursuit of legitimate academic objectives.\ne. Access to Information\nThe value of information as an institutional resource increases through its appropriate use; its value diminishes through misuse, misinterpretation, or unnecessary restrictions to its access.\n2. Classification of Information\nAll University information is classified into one of 4 levels based on sensitivity and risk. These classifications take into account legal protections, contractual agreements, ethical considerations, privacy issues, and strategic or proprietary worth. The classification level determines the security protections and access authorization mechanisms which must be used for the information. Security guidelines can be found in the Stanford Minimum Security Guidelines. The information classifications are as follows:\na. Prohibited Information\nInformation is classified as \"Prohibited\" if protection of the information is required by law or government regulation, or Stanford is required either to provide notice to the individual if information is inappropriately accessed or to report unauthorized access to the government\nb. Restricted Information\nInformation is classified as \"Restricted\" if (i) it would otherwise qualify as \"Prohibited\" but it has been determined by the Data Governance Board that prohibiting information storage on Computing Equipment would significantly reduce faculty, staff, or student effectiveness when acting in support of Stanford's mission, or (ii) it is listed as Restricted in the Classification of Common Data Elements. \nc. Confidential Information\nInformation is classified as \"Confidential\" if (i) it is not considered to be Prohibited or Restricted and is not generally available to the public, or (ii) it is listed as Confidential in the Classification of Common Data Elements.\nd. Public Information\nAll information which does not fall into one of these categories is considered to be \"public.\" Please see the Information Security Office for a list of frequently used public information.\nResponsibilities\na. Information Security Officer\nThe Information Security Officer is responsible for providing interpretation of this and other related policies and disseminating related information.\nb. University Privacy Officer\nThe University Privacy Officer is responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures governing the privacy of data that the University is required or elects to protect.\nc. Data Governance Board\nThe Data Governance Board is an advisory group charged with oversight of policies and procedures relating to the protection and use of Stanford's non-public information.\nd. Business and Data Owners\nSystem Business and Data Owners are responsible for the application of this and related policies to the systems, data, and other information resources under their care or control.\ne. System Administrators\nSystem Administrators are responsible for the application of this and related policies to the systems, information, and other information resources in their care at the direction of the Business and Data Owners.\nf. System Developers and Integrators\nSystem Developers and Integrators are responsible for the application of this and related policies to the systems, information, and other information resources in their care at the direction of the Business and Data Owners.\ng. Users\nEvery user of Stanford's information resources is responsible for the application of this and related policies to the systems, information, and other information resources which they use, access, transmit or store.\nh. Third-party Affiliates\nStanford expects all partners, consultants and vendors to abide by Stanford's information security and privacy policies. If non-public information is to be accessed or shared with these third parties, they should be bound by contract to abide by Stanford's information security and privacy policies.\n4. Violations of Policy and Misuse of Information\nViolations of this policy include, but are not limited to: accessing information to which the individual has no legitimate right; enabling unauthorized individuals to access information; disclosing information in a way that violates applicable policy, procedure, or other relevant regulations or laws; inappropriately modifying or destroying information; inadequately protecting information; or ignoring the explicit requirements of Data Owners for the proper management, use, and protection of information resources.\nViolations may result in network removal, access revocation, corrective action, and/or civil or criminal prosecution. Violators may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion, pursuant to campus policies, collective bargaining agreements, codes of conduct, or other instruments governing the individual's relationship with the University. Recourse shall be available under the appropriate section of the employee's personnel policy or contract, or by pursuing applicable legal procedure.\nAny School or Department found to have violated this policy may be held accountable for the financial penalties and remediation costs associated with a resulting information security incident.\nThird party vendors found to have violated this policy may incur financial liabilities, in addition to termination of contract.\n5.

Section 5 of this policy applies to all third-party vendors or service providers that conduct business at Stanford.\n1. Definition\nThe term \"card or payment account\" as used in this policy includes the use of credit or debit card accounts or account numbers (such as a bank account) or third party account numbers (such as a PayPal or Google accounts). For purposes of this policy, card or payment account acceptance and processing is defined as using any application or device for accepting a card or payment account as payment for goods or services sold by a Stanford University entity. This policy does not apply to the Stanford Card Plan, Cardinal Dollars or to the University's PCard or Travel credit card programs.\n2. Purpose\nA card or payment account provides a convenient way to handle business transactions such as conference registration, the purchase of course materials, or the purchase of meals at a campus dining facility. In order to accept card or payment account payments it is the University's best interest that the acceptance and processing is compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards for safeguarding card numbers, account numbers, and other High Risk Data as listed in Administrative Guide Memo 6.3.1: Information Security. In addition, funds from payments must be securely transferred to the University's financial systems. This policy is to establish guidelines for card or payment account acceptance and processing.\n3. Policy\na. Relation to University Mission\nAny use of card or payment account acceptance and processing methods at Stanford must be consistent with Administrative Guide Memo 1.5.3, Unrelated Business Activity, which prohibits the use of Stanford resources for any activity not related to the University's mission.\nb. Authorized Vendors and Service Provider\nDepartments must use a Stanford authorized payment application, payment mechanism, and point of sale terminal hardware vendor (if applicable). See the Gateway to Financial Activities (Fingate) website.\nA service provider that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data on behalf of the University must be validated as a Level 1 service provider by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and listed on Visa\u2019s Global Registry of Service Providers. The company listing must be current and the service being provided to the University must match the service listed on Visa\u2019s website.\nA company providing a service that can affect the security of an eCommerce transaction (eTransaction) must be validated by a QSA as a service provider and the service being provided to the University must match the services validated as compliant during the QSA assessment.\nc. University Card and Payment Account User Agreement\nDepartments wishing to engage in accepting card or payment accounts for the sale of goods or services must obtain approval from the Office of the Treasurer and comply with all terms of the University's Card and Payment Account User Agreement.\nd. Information Security\nCard and payment account numbers are classified as High Risk Data. Departments must comply with Administrative Guide Memo 6.3.1: Information Security, and safeguard the confidentiality of High Risk Data related to purchases of goods or services. They may not store any High Risk card or payment account information. They must only use equipment authorized by the Office of the Treasurer to process payment information and are required to use secure and approved, or PCI DSS certified, encrypted connections to transmit payment information.\ne. For departments operating electronic commerce websites:\nDepartments must post a privacy policy on their website that is approved by the University Privacy Officer or the Office of the General Counsel. Vendors and/or Service Providers who independently collect card or third party account information must have privacy and terms of use policies on their websites. These policies must conform to applicable federal and state laws, as well as the University's privacy policies.\nThird-party advertising is not allowed on any web pages which are hosted on the stanford.edu domain, or which use Stanford's name or emblems. Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the Vice President for Business Affairs and CFO. Advertising does not include mentioning the name of third parties that are co-sponsoring events with Stanford.\n4. Implementation Guidelines\nDepartments accepting card or payment accounts are responsible for complying with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and all card brand rules and regulations if applicable, or using secure standard financial industry practices, if PCI DSS standards are not applicable.\nInformation about requesting a merchant account for payment acceptance is available at the Office of the Treasurer's website. Departments must work with representatives from the Treasurer's Office and the Procurement Office to establish and manage card and payment account acceptance and processing.\n5. Third Party Vendors/Service Providers Operating on Stanford's Campus\nThird party vendors and service providers operating on Stanford's campus must handle data and other information generated from financial transactions involving the Stanford community (\"Data\") according to the Third Party Security Requirements listed on the Information Security Office\u2019s website.\n6.

Introduction\nBoth sponsored projects and gift-funded activities are externally-supported, with funds provided typically in response to a request or proposal. The classification of funding as \"gift\" or \"sponsored project\" will affect, among other things, the way Stanford University accounts for the funds, calculates and applies indirect (F&A) costs, and reports on the use of the funds to the sponsor or donor. For definitions of the various types of sponsored projects, see RPH: Categories of Sponsored Projects.\nAdministrative Staff involved in the processing of gifts, including cash, wire transfers or gifts of property, must complete Gift Administration at Stanford training.\nAdministrative Staff involved in sponsored research must complete Cardinal Curriculum Level I.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 2\nSponsored Projects are externally-funded activities in which a formal written agreement, i.e., a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, is entered into by Stanford University and by the sponsor. A sponsored project may be thought of as a transaction in which there is a specified statement of work with a related, reciprocal transfer of something of value.\nThe following conditions characterize a sponsored project agreement, and help to distinguish such agreements from gifts.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 3\nA. Statement of Work\nSponsored projects are typically awarded to Stanford in response to a detailed statement of work and commitment to a specified project plan. As described below, this statement of work is usually supported by both a project schedule and a line-item budget, both of which are essential to financial accountability. The statement of work and budget are usually described in a written proposal submitted by Stanford University to the sponsor for competitive review.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 4\nB. Detailed Financial Accountability\nThe sponsored project agreement includes detailed financial accountability, typically including such conditions as:\na line-item budget related to the project plan. The terms of the agreement may specify allowable or unallowable costs, requirements for prior approvals for particular expenditures, etc.\na requirement to return any unexpended funds at the end of that period\nregular financial reporting and audit, including, for federal and state awards, accountability under the terms of OMB A-21, OMB-110 or the Uniform Guidance\nA sponsored project budget will include the University's full negotiated indirect (F&A) cost rate unless a waiver of those costs has been approved. These conditions generally define the level of financial accountability associated with a sponsored project. While not all of the above conditions are necessary to define a sponsored project, they are collectively indicative of the increased level of financial accountability associated with such projects.\nC. Disposition of Properties (\"Deliverables\")\nSponsored project agreements also usually include terms and conditions for the disposition of tangible properties (e.g., equipment, records, specified technical reports, theses, or dissertations) or intangible properties (e.g., rights in data, copyrights, and inventions). The presence of such terms and conditions in the agreement indicate that the activity is a sponsored project.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 6\n3. Definition of Gifts\nA gift, on the other hand, is defined as any item of value given to the University by a donor who expects nothing significant of value in return, other than recognition and disposition of the gift in accordance with the donor's wishes. In general, the following characteristics describe a gift:\nA proposal/request may be submitted to the potential donor that includes a description of the proposed activities, with the understanding that the description of proposed activities is not intended as a commitment to a specific line of inquiry.\nGifts may be accompanied by an agreement that restricts the use of the funds to a particular purpose. Beyond that, no contractual requirements are imposed (beyond the requirements of responsible stewardship) and there are no \"deliverables\" to the donor, e.g., no rights to tangible or intellectual property.\nThere is no formal fiscal accountability to the donor beyond periodic progress reports and summary reports of expenditures. These reports may be thought of as requirements of stewardship, and, as such, may be required by the terms of a gift. They are not characterized as contractual obligations or \"deliverables.\"\nStanford agrees to use restricted gifts as the donor specifies, and does not accept gifts that it cannot use as the donor intends. If circumstances change such that a gift cannot be used as the donor specified, the donor must approve a change in the original restriction, or Stanford must receive court approval to waive the restriction (if the donor cannot be contacted). University approval for changes in the purpose of a gift fund can only be granted by the Provost.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 7\n4. Definitions of Fellowships, Scholarships and Other Student Aid\nFellowships are awards of financial support to individual named students or postdoctoral scholars, or to Stanford University on behalf of individual named students or postdoctoral scholars. At Stanford, fellowships funds are normally categorized as an award of \u201cStudent Aid\u201d. However where the award of funding is made to Stanford University, where Stanford names the individuals to receive the support, and where the funds are to support research training, the funds are treated as a research training grant, a type of sponsored research project. See Attachment B. Checklist for Determining Whether Funding is a Postdoctoral Fellowship or a Sponsored Project below.\nIn order to facilitate the proper handling of fellowship support, the following procedures apply to proposal and award processes:\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 8\nA. Undergraduate or Graduate Students (External Funding)\nStudents may apply for external fellowships in their own name. The process for submitting proposals will vary, depending on whether an institutional endorsement of the application is required by the funding source.\nSubmissions requiring an institutional endorsement are submitted through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or, in the School of Medicine, through the Research Management Group (RMG) Fellowship Office.\nSubmissions which do not require an institutional endorsement may be submitted directly by the student.\nWhere funds are given to Stanford University to support named undergraduate or graduate students, those funds are received and processed through the Financial Aid Office, which administers the distribution of funds. Stanford University classifies these funds as \u201cStudent Aid.\u201d\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 9\nB. Postdoctoral Scholars\nPostdoctoral Scholars who wish to apply for external fellowship funding must submit their application through either OSR or, in the School of Medicine, through RMG Fellowship Office. Awarded funds are received and processed by OSR, which administers the distribution of funds.\nPostdoctoral Fellowships are not normally defined as sponsored projects. However, because they typically provide support for the recipient\u2019s research activities, applications are processed through the research administration offices of the University. This process helps to assure appropriate internal controls as well as the inclusion of costs in the appropriate base for the calculations of Stanford\u2019s indirect (F&A) cost rates and the appropriate classification of the research space.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 10\n5. Implementation and Administrative Issues\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 11\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 12\nDistinctions Based on Source of Funds\nAny funding provided by U.S. Government agencies, at the federal, state, or local level, in support of Stanford activities is a sponsored project. Government funds are not gifts.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 13\nIn remaining cases, e.g., where funding is being provided by corporations, foundations or others not specified above, the distinction between gifts and sponsored projects will be made based on the proposal, statement of work, and terms of the agreement, taking into consideration the intent of the donor/sponsor.\nIn some situations, communication, including the proposal and award as well as conversations, makes it clear that the donor\u2019s/ sponsor\u2019s intent is to classify an award to Stanford as either a gift or a sponsored project. In these cases, the terms of the accompanying agreement may have to be adjusted in consultation with the donor/sponsor in order to clearly document the intent and avoid unintended classification.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 14\nB. Administrative Issues\n1. Decision-Making in Unclear Situations\nIn some cases, the distinction between gift and grant, i.e., between a gift and a sponsored project, can be difficult to draw. Donors may sometimes use the word \"grant\" when the donation qualifies as a \"gift\" or vice versa. To ensure proper classification of gifts the Stanford Gift Transmittal system must be used.\nIf there are questions about the analysis or the user is unable to make a determination of gift or sponsored project, contact your Institutional Official in OSR or RMG.\nStaff members from OSR, RMG or Corporate and Foundation Relations should consult as needed with the Associate Vice Provost for Research.\n2. Donor/Sponsor Relations\nIn resolving issues related to the classification of an award, Stanford personnel must maintain an appropriate balance between the interests and preferences of the donor/sponsor and the University's administrative policies and objectives. In the process of resolving these issues it may be necessary to contact the donor/sponsor for clarification of intent and requirements, and/or to discuss the planned use of the funds.\nIf after consultation with the donor/sponsor there are still uncertainties about the donor/sponsor intent, a Conditions of Gift Letter should be used. Such contacts are usually best handled by the faculty member and/or development officer who initiated the activity.\n3. Account Set-Up\nAdministrative Guide Memo 3.1.3: Activities/Accounts, specifies the procedure and responsibilities for establishing both sponsored project and gift accounts. Whenever a new account is requested, the responsible organization (Office of Sponsored Research in the case of sponsored projects, or Fund Accounting in the case of gift funding) verifies that the account (PTA) being set up is proper, in accordance with the definitions in this policy. These offices are responsible for assuring that a proper determination of gift or grant status has been made.\n4. Indirect (Facilities & Administrative (F&A)) Cost Implications\nStanford's policy is to apply the University's full applicable indirect (F&A) cost rate to all sponsored projects. Gift funds will be assessed an infrastructure charge set by Stanford University, in accordance with the Infrastructure Charge Policy, Administrative Guide Memo 3.3.1. See in Related Items below RPH 15.2, Indirect Cost (F&A) Waivers for guidance relating to requesting waivers of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) costs are not charged on Fellowships, Scholarships or other student aid.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 15\nAttachment A. to this policy, the Job Aid for Determining Whether Funding is a Gift or Support for a Sponsored Project, reflects the on-line process through the Gift Transmittal System.

The certification of salary expenditures confirms that salaries charged to the account are supported by a corresponding expenditure of effort during the time period being certified. The certification also assures that other expenditures are for items or services purchased and used during the project period as specified by the award.\nUniversity policy RPH 3.2: Management of Project Expenditures requires a quarterly review and certification of expenditures for sponsored project and cost sharing accounts by the Principal Investigator.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 1\nThe Quarterly PI Review\nThe PI has overall responsibility for the technical and fiscal management of a sponsored project. This includes the management of the project within funding limitations, adherence to reporting requirements and assurance that the sponsor will be notified when significant conditions related to project status change. \nWhile responsibility for the day-to-day management of project finances may be delegated to administrative or other staff, accountability for compliance with Stanford policy and sponsor requirements ultimately rests with the PI.\nQuarterly Certification cannot be delegated. It must be done by the Principal Investigator. (Monthly review can be done by a knowledgeable administrative staff member).\nFaculty who are not Principal Investigators and whose salary is charged to sponsored projects must review and certify their payroll distribution.\nExpenditures must be reviewed and certified in the ecertification system by the certification due date, which is approximately 75 days after the end of the academic quarter being certified.\nThe following certification statement appears in the eCertification System.\nAs the principal investigator I confirm that to the best of my knowledge, salary and wages charged to this project are appropriate in relation to work performed on this project.

The largest program included in the supplemental rate is the tuition grant program (TGP). Also included are university-wide programs that benefit faculty and staff. Please contact Neil Hamilton at neil.hamilton@stanford.edu of the University Budget Office for questions related to the TGP and supplemental rate.\nTuition Grant Program Fringe Rate\nFringe Benefit rates do not include the Tuition Grant Program fringe rate. The Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTAs including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs. The TGP rate is applied to regular benefits eligible employee salaries paid by non-government sponsors in addition to the fringe benefit rate. The TGP rate contributes to the University's fund for continuation of the Tuition Grant Program for children of faculty and staff. For further information on the TGP rate, please contact the University Budget Office.\nNote 2: Starting Sept. 1, 2022, Stanford increased the subsidy for Cardinal Care health insurance from 50% to 100% for graduate students who are supported on research and teaching assistantships at 25% level or higher (or fellowships at a comparable level) and who are in good academic standing. RAs and TAs with a <25% appointment will receive a 50% subsidy.\nTo fund the increased subsidy for RAs/TAs, an additional supplemental fringe rate is charged on graduate RA/TA salaries as a separate item on a different expenditure type (ET 51785). However, to protect sponsored research budgets, this supplemental rate is only charged on non\u2010sponsored PTAs.\nFull accounting details for these expenses including can be found on the Fingate website under Accounting for Increased Graduate Cardinal Care Subsidy.\nMore information about the Cardinal Care subsidy can be found on the Financial Aid Office website.\nHow Fringe Rates are Calculated \nStanford uses multiple fringe benefits rates developed under the requirements of 2 CFR 200). Since September 1, 2002, Stanford has used four different rates for different categories of employees, as described below.\nEach rate is calculated by the development of a pool of fringe benefits costs (the numerator) and of a salary and wage base (denominator). The pool consists of costs for the benefits provided to a particular category of employees. When the pool is divided by the base applicable to that category of employees, a rate results; this rate represents the percentage that must be added to employees\u2019 salary and wage dollars.\nThe categories of employees having separate fringe benefits rates are as follows: 1. Regular Benefits-Eligible Employees; 2. Post-Doctoral Affiliates; 3. Contingent (casual or temporary) Employees; and 4. Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants. (Other student salaries have a benefits rate of zero.)\nRegular benefits-eligible employees are those faculty and staff who hold an appointment of at least six months (four months for bargaining unit employees) for at least 50% time and thus are eligible for Stanford\u2019s retirement and health and welfare benefits programs. Post-doctoral affiliates are advanced nonmatriculating students employed by Stanford to perform services related primarily to Stanford research projects. Contingent employees are those whose appointments are too brief (i.e., less than six months, or four months for bargaining unit employees) or too few hours (i.e., less than 50% time) to make them eligible for regular benefits. Graduate research and teaching assistants (RAs and TAs) are students whose RA or TA appointments are at least 25% (for the full University contribution to the cost of student health insurance) or 10% (for a half contribution by the University).\nRegular benefits-eligible salaries charged to government-funded PTA\u2019s, academic service centers and sponsored project cost sharing PTA\u2019s are exempt from the TGP charge.\nThe TGP charge is subject to facilities and administrative costs (F&A) and infrastructure charges. The TGP charge appears in expenditure type 51770 FRINGE BENEFITS TGP.\nIf you have any questions or need more information about the application of the TGP Fringe Benefit Rate, please contact the University Budget Office or, Research Administration Policy and Compliance, at extension 3-9102.\nOther registered Stanford undergraduate and graduate students have no benefits charges applied against their wages; this is because these students receive no fringe benefits. Students who are employed by the University during a quarter in which they are not registered (including summer quarter) must be classified as contingent employees until they are registered again.\nThe fringe benefits pool comprises the following categories of cost:\nRETIREMENT PROGRAMS, including social security, contributory plans, early retirement incentive programs, etc.\nINSURANCE PROGRAMS, including health, dental, group life, disability, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation, post-employment medical, travel insurance, and other.\nMISCELLANEOUS PROGRAMS, including staff development, severance pay, sabbaticals, benefits counseling, etc.\nTUITION GRANT PROGRAMS (TGP), for children of eligible faculty and staff, was included in the negotiated fringe benefits pool through Fiscal Year 1999, but has since been distributed by means of a separate charge against non-government salaries only.\nThe salary bases for fringe benefits consist of all salaries and wages paid to each category of employee. Sabbatical and long-term disability payments, which are themselves fringe benefits, are not included in any salary base.\nStanford\u2019s fringe benefits rates are established under 2 CFR 200., \u201cNegotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions,\u201d which provide for the negotiation of fixed rates in advance for a fiscal year. Any over- or under-recovery for that year is included as an adjustment to the appropriate fringe benefits rate for a subsequent year.\nTuition Grant Program\nThe University applies the TGP rate to regular benefits-eligible salaries to support the costs of the Tuition Grant Program (Admin Guide Memo 2.3.3, \"Tuition Privileges\").\nEffective September 1, 1999, the Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTA\u2019s including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs.\nRate Agreements \nFY24 Fixed Staff Benefits Rate agreement with ONR.

The vacation accrual/DSL rates will be charged at the time of the salary expenditure. No salary will be charged to the award when the employee is on vacation.\"\nThese rates do not apply to SLAC\n\nAbout \nStanford provides vacation to its regular staff employees. The accrual rates enable Stanford to charge the appropriate funding source for the vacation earned by benefits-eligible staff as they are working. The rates will charge vacation as it is earned, rather than as it is taken. Application of the rates will build a central university fund to pay for vacation salary when staff either take vacation or leave the University.\nFor more information on how Vacation Accrual and/or Disability Sick Leave rates will impact a sponsored award, visit the ORA Budgets and Budget Justifications webpage.\nNOTE: Faculty members do not accrue vacation leave or sick leave.

The subsidy appears on expenditure statements in expenditure type 57640 GS Health Insurance Recovery. The financial system automatically applies the surcharge to eligible transactions in the form of a rate.\nBoth the surcharge and RA/TA fringe subsidize eligible graduate student Cardinal Care health insurance. The Provost\u2019s Office reviews and adjusts the GSS rate as necessary each fiscal year. \nExpenditure Types Subject to GSS\nExp Type\tDescription\t\n57340\tGFS STANDARD CHGS\t\n57510\n57520\n\t\nGRADUATE STUDENT STIPEND\nGFS GRD STU SUPPLY TRAVEL STPD\n\t\nIn general, stipend payments (charged to the expenditure types listed above) from Stanford operating budget PTAs, or from School or Department PTAs, will be assessed the GSS rate. \nAll fellowships awarded by external sources, where the awards, projects and tasks are established by the Office of Sponsored Research are EXCLUDED from the application of this surcharge (award range PAAAA-VZZZZ). In addition, no GSS is applied on cost sharing PTAs, miscellaneous receivables, capital projects, service centers or auxiliaries.\nFellowship stipends paid to Postdoctoral Scholars (expenditure type 57840) and to non-matriculated students including Visiting Researchers (expenditure type 57860) are NOT charged the GSS rate, as neither of these groups receives a Cardinal Care subsidy.\nInstitutional Allowances\nSome externally-funded fellowships, such as NIH Training Grants or NSF Fellowships, provide an institutional allowance for the benefit of the fellow. This allowance is exempt from GSS. When the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) transfers this allowance to a departmental PTA, the PTA is exempt from the GSS surcharge. Expenditures subject/not subject to GSS should not be commingled in the same PTA.\nImplementing Infrastructure \nImplementing the Revised Infrastructure Charge (ISC) Policy More information about this policy can be found in the Stanford Administrative Guide 8.3.1\nAugust 31, 2005\tRev: November 8, 2010\t\nThe Board of Trustees of Stanford University approved a revised infrastructure policy in October 2004.The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge from 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted funds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry an F&A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or transferred.\nGifts for building projects are waived from the infrastructure charges. Gifts of donated capital equipment are waived from infrastructure. However, restricted funds used to purchase capital equipment will be assessed ISC.\nThe infrastructure charge collected from non formula schools will be credited 75% to a central university PFOO (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central PFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected from formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO belonging to the formula school or auxiliary.\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all.\nThis guide provides additional detail implementing Administrative Guide Memo 3.3.1 Infrastructure Charges.\nInfrastructure Charge\nAwards are subject to the revised infrastructure policy as follows (see additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects below):\nDesignated funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on revenue in General Ledger codes 43xxx, 44xxx and 46xxx. The charge will appear on the fund statement only in General Ledger codes 48990 or 48992. \nExpendable gift and endowment income funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures and fund transfers including transfers to operating budgets and designated funds. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935 on the expenditure statement. The charge on fund transfers will appear in General Ledger codes 49710 or 49720 on the fund statement only. Expendable gift and endowment income funds marked \"Donor Exempt\" prior to September 1, 2005 are waived from infrastructure. All other expendable gift and endowment income funds are subject to the revised infrastructure policy.\nNon-government and foreign government sponsored project awards are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935.\nOperating budgets, budget pools, service centers, auxiliaries, miscellaneous receivables, reserves, pending funds, U.S. government sponsored projects, University Research, plant, student loans, agency and living trust funds/awards and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are waived from infrastructure by the revised policy.\nThe utility charge is discontinued.\nThe following schedules define the revised infrastructure process in detail:\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE (ISC) POLICY BY AWARD TYPE AND PURPOSE defines the categories of awards subject to the revised policy and the infrastructure charge they are assessed.\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY TO FUND TRANSFERS defines the types of fund transfers that are assessed the infrastructure charge. (file updated 9/26/2008)\nThe schedule FUND TRANSFERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE defines the fund transfer General Ledger codes subject to the infrastructure charge.\nExample \u2013 Fund Transfer and Infrastructure \u2013 An example of a fund transfer from a gift to an operating budget.\nThe schedule BURDEN EXPENDITURE TYPE MAPPING SCHEDULE defines the expenditure types subject to the infrastructure charge. The new ISC charge is applied to most expenditure types.\nThe schedule INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGE EXPENDITURE TYPES/GENERAL LEDGER CODES defines the expenditure types and general ledger codes where the infrastructure assessment will appear.\nInfrastructure Exemptions and Waivers\nAny exceptions to the revised ISC Policy require approval of both the Provost and CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all. If the source of funds, typically a donor or sponsor, will not pay the infrastructure charge, the department or office may request to pay the charge themselves by applying to the Budget Office for permission to use an alternate PTA (project/task/award). Departments must use the \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form. The alternate source of funds must be able to support an expense of this nature. Designated, endowment income or expendable funds may be used. Sponsored projects may not be used. See additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects and exemptions below. If the exemption is not granted by the Provost and the Chief Financial Officer, the funds must be refused.\nAny questions about requesting a waiver to the ISC Policy should be directed to Dana Shelley in the Budget Office at ext 5-1256.\nA waiver of F&A (indirect costs) granted by the Dean of Research does not waive infrastructure.\nInfrastructure and Sponsored Projects\nThe revised Infrastructure Charge Policy applies to sponsored project awards assessed an F&A rate of 0%. Awards with F& A rates between 0% and 8% are not charged infrastructure but instead are charged their negotiated F&A rates.\nHowever, all sponsored projects awards with award start dates prior to 9/01/05 and awards made in response to previously-submitted sponsored projects proposals will continue to be subject to the prior ISC policy until the end of their competitive segment. At the time these projects are renewed, funding must be requested using the revised ISC guidelines.\nSponsored project awards are subject to the revised Infrastructure Charge Policy as follows:\nThe infrastructure charge is waived on all U.S. government - funded sponsored project awards. This includes awards directly funded by a federal, state or local governmental agency and awards that are funded on a \u201cflow-through\u201d basis using government monies.\nThe infrastructure charge is exempted (e.g., an alternate PTA is provided by the PI/department to pay the ISC charge) on all non-government sponsored project awards where the sponsor has a written policy stating that it does not pay indirect costs.\nEffective 9/1/05, if a sponsor/program is not waived or exempted under the rules listed above, the PI/administering department must include the infrastructure charge in their proposal/budget request to the sponsor. Institutional officials are responsible for reviewing proposals to make sure that the charge has been included, prior to endorsing the proposal on behalf of Stanford, or that an approved \u201cexemption\u201d (see below) is on file.\nIf a sponsor/program is not exempted as outlined above, the department may request to pay the infrastructure via an alternate PTA by submitting a \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form to the Provost Office. Exemptions must be approved in advance of submission of a proposal.\nUnobligated funds remaining at the expiration of a fixed price sponsored project that are transferred to a departmental PTA on or after September 1, 1999, are not subject to the infrastructure charge provided the funds were assessed an F&A rate of 8% or greater. These funds are transferred to a departmental PTA, less the facilities and administrative costs (formerly referred to as indirect costs) that would have been assessed on additional project expenditures.\nInstitutional allowances associated with fellowships are exempt from infrastructure. Best practices recommend the institutional allowance should be spent on the sponsored award. However, the schools and departments may transfer the allowance to an existing PTA where the expenditure will not be assessed infrastructure. Please contact your OSR representative for additional guidance.\nFor questions about infrastructure charge policy, exemptions or waivers, contact Dana Shelley. For questions related to sponsored projects please contact Vrinda Gopal. For all other inquiries, please call your Fund Accounting representative or the Manager of Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office.\nSIP \nThe Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) consists of projects and programs proposed and developed for the betterment and general support of the University's academic community and its physical plant. The infrastructure system directly supports the academic missions of teaching and research and the overall vitality of the institution. This infrastructure will be developed as necessary to improve public safety and service and to promote conservation in land use and resources.\nFor more information on SIP go to Administrative Guide Memo 8.3.1.\nNon-Sponsored Receivables Rates Table\nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY24 (Predetermined)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY23 (Predetermined)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t\nFY 22 (FINAL)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY 21 (FINAL)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY20\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY19\t56.5%\t8%*\t56.5%\t\nNon-Sponsored Receivables Rates before FY19 \nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY 18\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY17\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY16\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY15\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 14\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 13\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY12\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY11\t8%\t0%\t58% (2a)\t\nFY10\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY09\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY08\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY07\t8%\t0%\t56.5%\t\nFY06\t8%\t0%\t56%\t\nFY05\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY04\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nNotes \n*The FY 2023 and 2024 Stanford Affiliate Rate for Stanford Affiliate external customers/users remains at 8% Total Direct Costs for service centers, cores/shared facilities in departments, schools, labs, institutes, and centers.

To begin a sale, your customer may offer a card for payment in one of three ways:\nBy inserting a chip card into the dip slot at the front of the device or PIN pad\nBy swiping the card through the magnetic stripe reader\nBy tapping a contactless card or phone\nLearn how to complete a transaction on your Clover device.\nVoid \nA void is a type of refund that is done before a transaction is settled.\nLearn how to void a transaction on your Clover device prior to closing the batch.\nRefund \nIf a transaction has already settled and you need to refund the cardholder, your only option is to perform a refund.\nLearn how to refund a transaction on your Clover device from a closed batch.\nBatch \nA batch is a single submission to the merchant bank of a group of transactions (sales and credits) for settlement. A batch usually represents a day's worth of transactions. \nLearn how to close out batch on your Clover device manually.\nOffline \nWhen the internet connection is down or weak, you can continue to take payments up to a pre-authorized limit, by enabling the offline payments option. When a connection becomes available, the Clover device automatically submits offline payments for authorization. Once authorized, you receive the funds and customers receive receipts. Please refer to Clover help center for more information on getting funded for offline transactions.\nPlease note that when you take an offline payment, you assume the risk of a declined transaction when the device is back online up to the limit you have pre authorized for each transaction. For example, if a credit card is expired or canceled, or if the PIN is incorrect, the payment will be declined once back online. If a payment is over the limit, it will be declined in the offline status at the time the card is presented.\nThere is no way of validating an offline transaction. It is ultimately a business decision by the department owner on whether to allow offline payments or not, and how much the limit should be. Sometimes it is better to capture an offline transaction versus not to capture payments at all.\nNetwork Connectivity \nDepending on the model types, POS equipment usually connects over a secure analog dedicated phone line, cellular network, secured Wi-Fi, open Wi-Fi (for P2PE only) or Ethernet. For merchants using Clover devices, you can choose any of these methods to securely connect your devices to the internet with:\nAT&T cellular connection through the device's mobile SIM card\nPersonal hotspot through your mobile device with required password\nOff-campus secured Wifi such as hotel or event venue with required password\nEthernet cable that you plug in from a router to the device. Please contact MS for setup instructions.\nOn-campus \u201ceduroam\u201d WiFi with instructions. Merchants can connect to the secure network \u201ceduroam\u201d WiFi option available on the Stanford campus. MS asks that the merchant: \nAssign a device manager who has a SUnet ID who will be responsible for the device. Only a Stanford stakeholder with a SUnet ID may access the eduroam WiFi network. Have the device manager log in to Eduroam using their credentials, using Clover Flex Connection instruction.\nIf needed, sponsor a base SUNet ID for the person, if they are not already part of Stanford. \nEnsure that anyone who will handle the credit card transaction complete the PCI compliance training, including casual, temp, student workers, and/or third-party vendors.\nSignatures\nVisa does not require signatures on EMV chip cards, but signatures are still required if cards are swiped. It is up to the merchants to verify cardholders, but to reduce friction at the point of sale, merchants can verify the cardholders with the following:\nMerchants are not required to check security features on the chip card.\nMerchants are not required to verify that the signature on the receipt matches the one on the chip card.\nMerchants do not need to treat chip cards with unsigned/blank signature panels differently from other transactions.\nMerchants must not refuse payment based on how the payment is presented. For example, a contactless-capable merchant cannot choose to accept near-field communication-enabled mobile devices without accepting a physical contactless-enabled card.\nMerchants may also stop seeing a signature panel on the back of a MasterCard because cards with chips eliminate the need to compare signatures. The three-digit security code will remain.\nEMV/Contactless \nEMV stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, a global standard for inter-operation of integrated circuit cards (IC cards or chip cards). EMV cards or chip cards are a more secure form of payment for customers. EMV-enabled equipment allows customers to dip their cards instead of swiping. The chip on the card encrypts card information, so it\u2019s more difficult for thieves to steal cardholder data. \nPOS merchants who use EMV-capable equipment can process contactless payments using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Both contactless card and mobile wallet (e.g., Apple Pay) enabled smart devices to communicate payment information directly when hovering closely over the NFC-enabled POS equipment.\nBenefits of Contactless Payments:\nFast: Enables faster and more convenient transactions\nSecure: Transactions are protected by encryption technology and minimize fraud\nSafe: Avoids physical contact with the POS device\nSet Up Support\nBelow are quick reference guides for Clover devices available through Wells Fargo. \nClover Flex Set Up GuideClover \nP2PE Implementation Manual \nIf you have additional questions concerning your setup, please contact the Wells Fargo help desk at 800-622-0842 or visit the Online Clover Help Center."}

Indirect costs are known as Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs and are expressed in terms of a rate. The F&A rate is applied to eligible direct costs. For more information on the application of F&A rates, see Budget Components in the Research Administration section of this website.\nIn addition to the F&A rate, this page contains other rates that are applicable to sponsored projects and other types of institutional activities.\nFacilities and Administrative (F&A) Cost Rates\nF&A Cost Rates Table\nFiscal\nYear Organized\nResearch Sponsored\nInstruction Other Sponsored\nActivity Animal\nCare Agrmnt\nDate \n\tOn \tOff\tOn \tOff\tOn \tOff\t\t\t\nFY24 (Predetermined)\t54.4%\t29.3%\t40.8%\t30.5%\t40.3%\t27.3%\t78.7%\t8/30/22\t\nFY23 (Predetermined)\t55.3%\t29.4%\t41.0%\t30.5%\t40.5%\t27.3%\t79.2%\t8/30/22\t\nFY22 (Final)\t57.4%\t29.2%\t35.0%\t27.7%\t36.0%\t29.2%\t72.0%\t9/30/20\t\nFY21\t57.7%\t29.3%\t35.0%\t27.7%\t35.9%\t29.2%\t75.0%\t9/30/20\t\nFY20\t57.7%\t29.2%\t38.1%\t28.7%\t38.8%\t28.6%\t81%*\t8/27/19\t\nFY19 (Final)\t56.5%\t29.3%\t37.7%\t28.6%\t37.8%\t28.4%\t79.6%*\t8/27/19\t\nFY19 (Prov.)\t56.5%\t29.3%\t37.7%\t28.6%\t37.8%\t28.4%\t79.6%*\t9/13/18\t\nF&A Cost Rates before FY19 \nFiscal\nYear\nOrganized\nResearch\nSponsored\nInstruction\nOther Sponsored\nActivity\nAnimal\nCare\nAgrmnt\nDate\n\tOn \tOff\tOn \tOff\tOn \tOff\t\t\t\nFY18\t57%\t30%\t56%\t30.30%\t38%\t28.50%\t83%*\t8/2/16\t\nFY17 \n\t57%\t30%\t56%\t30.30%\t38%\t28.50%\t83%*\t8/2/16\t\nFY16\t58%\t30%\t56%\t30.30%\t38%\t28.50%\t83*%\t5/20/15\t\nFY15\t59%\t30%\t55.35%\t30.15%\t38.47%\t28.42%\t80*%\t5/20/15\t\nFY14\t60.5%\t30.4%\t57.5%\t36.3%\t61.6%\t36.9%\t77.9%\t8/19/13\t\nFY13\t57.0%\t30.2%\t59.8%\t32%\t46.0%\t31.0%\t71.6%\t8/19/13\t\nFY12\t57.00%\t30.20%\t61.00%\t32.00%\t46.00%\t31.00%\t84.0%\t8/5/11\t\nFY11\t56.60%\t30.50%1\t61.00%1\t32.00%\t46.00%1\t31.00%\t84.00%\t8/5/11\t\nFootnote1\tFY11 final rates increased from provisional rates.

The largest program included in the supplemental rate is the tuition grant program (TGP). Also included are university-wide programs that benefit faculty and staff. Please contact Neil Hamilton at neil.hamilton@stanford.edu of the University Budget Office for questions related to the TGP and supplemental rate.\nTuition Grant Program Fringe Rate\nFringe Benefit rates do not include the Tuition Grant Program fringe rate. The Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTAs including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs. The TGP rate is applied to regular benefits eligible employee salaries paid by non-government sponsors in addition to the fringe benefit rate. The TGP rate contributes to the University's fund for continuation of the Tuition Grant Program for children of faculty and staff. For further information on the TGP rate, please contact the University Budget Office.\nNote 2: Starting Sept. 1, 2022, Stanford increased the subsidy for Cardinal Care health insurance from 50% to 100% for graduate students who are supported on research and teaching assistantships at 25% level or higher (or fellowships at a comparable level) and who are in good academic standing. RAs and TAs with a <25% appointment will receive a 50% subsidy.\nTo fund the increased subsidy for RAs/TAs, an additional supplemental fringe rate is charged on graduate RA/TA salaries as a separate item on a different expenditure type (ET 51785). However, to protect sponsored research budgets, this supplemental rate is only charged on non\u2010sponsored PTAs.\nFull accounting details for these expenses including can be found on the Fingate website under Accounting for Increased Graduate Cardinal Care Subsidy.\nMore information about the Cardinal Care subsidy can be found on the Financial Aid Office website.\nHow Fringe Rates are Calculated \nStanford uses multiple fringe benefits rates developed under the requirements of 2 CFR 200). Since September 1, 2002, Stanford has used four different rates for different categories of employees, as described below.\nEach rate is calculated by the development of a pool of fringe benefits costs (the numerator) and of a salary and wage base (denominator). The pool consists of costs for the benefits provided to a particular category of employees. When the pool is divided by the base applicable to that category of employees, a rate results; this rate represents the percentage that must be added to employees\u2019 salary and wage dollars.\nThe categories of employees having separate fringe benefits rates are as follows: 1. Regular Benefits-Eligible Employees; 2. Post-Doctoral Affiliates; 3. Contingent (casual or temporary) Employees; and 4. Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants. (Other student salaries have a benefits rate of zero.)\nRegular benefits-eligible employees are those faculty and staff who hold an appointment of at least six months (four months for bargaining unit employees) for at least 50% time and thus are eligible for Stanford\u2019s retirement and health and welfare benefits programs. Post-doctoral affiliates are advanced nonmatriculating students employed by Stanford to perform services related primarily to Stanford research projects. Contingent employees are those whose appointments are too brief (i.e., less than six months, or four months for bargaining unit employees) or too few hours (i.e., less than 50% time) to make them eligible for regular benefits. Graduate research and teaching assistants (RAs and TAs) are students whose RA or TA appointments are at least 25% (for the full University contribution to the cost of student health insurance) or 10% (for a half contribution by the University).\nRegular benefits-eligible salaries charged to government-funded PTA\u2019s, academic service centers and sponsored project cost sharing PTA\u2019s are exempt from the TGP charge.\nThe TGP charge is subject to facilities and administrative costs (F&A) and infrastructure charges. The TGP charge appears in expenditure type 51770 FRINGE BENEFITS TGP.\nIf you have any questions or need more information about the application of the TGP Fringe Benefit Rate, please contact the University Budget Office or, Research Administration Policy and Compliance, at extension 3-9102.\nOther registered Stanford undergraduate and graduate students have no benefits charges applied against their wages; this is because these students receive no fringe benefits. Students who are employed by the University during a quarter in which they are not registered (including summer quarter) must be classified as contingent employees until they are registered again.\nThe fringe benefits pool comprises the following categories of cost:\nRETIREMENT PROGRAMS, including social security, contributory plans, early retirement incentive programs, etc.\nINSURANCE PROGRAMS, including health, dental, group life, disability, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation, post-employment medical, travel insurance, and other.\nMISCELLANEOUS PROGRAMS, including staff development, severance pay, sabbaticals, benefits counseling, etc.\nTUITION GRANT PROGRAMS (TGP), for children of eligible faculty and staff, was included in the negotiated fringe benefits pool through Fiscal Year 1999, but has since been distributed by means of a separate charge against non-government salaries only.\nThe salary bases for fringe benefits consist of all salaries and wages paid to each category of employee. Sabbatical and long-term disability payments, which are themselves fringe benefits, are not included in any salary base.\nStanford\u2019s fringe benefits rates are established under 2 CFR 200., \u201cNegotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions,\u201d which provide for the negotiation of fixed rates in advance for a fiscal year. Any over- or under-recovery for that year is included as an adjustment to the appropriate fringe benefits rate for a subsequent year.\nTuition Grant Program\nThe University applies the TGP rate to regular benefits-eligible salaries to support the costs of the Tuition Grant Program (Admin Guide Memo 2.3.3, \"Tuition Privileges\").\nEffective September 1, 1999, the Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTA\u2019s including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs.\nRate Agreements \nFY24 Fixed Staff Benefits Rate agreement with ONR.

The vacation accrual/DSL rates will be charged at the time of the salary expenditure. No salary will be charged to the award when the employee is on vacation.\"\nThese rates do not apply to SLAC\n\nAbout \nStanford provides vacation to its regular staff employees. The accrual rates enable Stanford to charge the appropriate funding source for the vacation earned by benefits-eligible staff as they are working. The rates will charge vacation as it is earned, rather than as it is taken. Application of the rates will build a central university fund to pay for vacation salary when staff either take vacation or leave the University.\nFor more information on how Vacation Accrual and/or Disability Sick Leave rates will impact a sponsored award, visit the ORA Budgets and Budget Justifications webpage.\nNOTE: Faculty members do not accrue vacation leave or sick leave. Short absences for personal business, illness, jury duty, military duty, and similarly limited absences normally are with full salary.

The subsidy appears on expenditure statements in expenditure type 57640 GS Health Insurance Recovery. The financial system automatically applies the surcharge to eligible transactions in the form of a rate.\nBoth the surcharge and RA/TA fringe subsidize eligible graduate student Cardinal Care health insurance. The Provost\u2019s Office reviews and adjusts the GSS rate as necessary each fiscal year. \nExpenditure Types Subject to GSS\nExp Type\tDescription\t\n57340\tGFS STANDARD CHGS\t\n57510\n57520\n\t\nGRADUATE STUDENT STIPEND\nGFS GRD STU SUPPLY TRAVEL STPD\n\t\nIn general, stipend payments (charged to the expenditure types listed above) from Stanford operating budget PTAs, or from School or Department PTAs, will be assessed the GSS rate. \nAll fellowships awarded by external sources, where the awards, projects and tasks are established by the Office of Sponsored Research are EXCLUDED from the application of this surcharge (award range PAAAA-VZZZZ). In addition, no GSS is applied on cost sharing PTAs, miscellaneous receivables, capital projects, service centers or auxiliaries.\nFellowship stipends paid to Postdoctoral Scholars (expenditure type 57840) and to non-matriculated students including Visiting Researchers (expenditure type 57860) are NOT charged the GSS rate, as neither of these groups receives a Cardinal Care subsidy.\nInstitutional Allowances\nSome externally-funded fellowships, such as NIH Training Grants or NSF Fellowships, provide an institutional allowance for the benefit of the fellow. This allowance is exempt from GSS. When the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) transfers this allowance to a departmental PTA, the PTA is exempt from the GSS surcharge. Expenditures subject/not subject to GSS should not be commingled in the same PTA.\nImplementing Infrastructure \nImplementing the Revised Infrastructure Charge (ISC) Policy More information about this policy can be found in the Stanford Administrative Guide 8.3.1\nAugust 31, 2005\tRev: November 8, 2010\t\nThe Board of Trustees of Stanford University approved a revised infrastructure policy in October 2004.The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge from 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted funds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry an F&A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or transferred.\nGifts for building projects are waived from the infrastructure charges. Gifts of donated capital equipment are waived from infrastructure. However, restricted funds used to purchase capital equipment will be assessed ISC.\nThe infrastructure charge collected from non formula schools will be credited 75% to a central university PFOO (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central PFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected from formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO belonging to the formula school or auxiliary.\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all.\nThis guide provides additional detail implementing Administrative Guide Memo 3.3.1 Infrastructure Charges.\nInfrastructure Charge\nAwards are subject to the revised infrastructure policy as follows (see additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects below):\nDesignated funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on revenue in General Ledger codes 43xxx, 44xxx and 46xxx. The charge will appear on the fund statement only in General Ledger codes 48990 or 48992. \nExpendable gift and endowment income funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures and fund transfers including transfers to operating budgets and designated funds. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935 on the expenditure statement. The charge on fund transfers will appear in General Ledger codes 49710 or 49720 on the fund statement only. Expendable gift and endowment income funds marked \"Donor Exempt\" prior to September 1, 2005 are waived from infrastructure. All other expendable gift and endowment income funds are subject to the revised infrastructure policy.\nNon-government and foreign government sponsored project awards are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935.\nOperating budgets, budget pools, service centers, auxiliaries, miscellaneous receivables, reserves, pending funds, U.S. government sponsored projects, University Research, plant, student loans, agency and living trust funds/awards and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are waived from infrastructure by the revised policy.\nThe utility charge is discontinued.\nThe following schedules define the revised infrastructure process in detail:\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE (ISC) POLICY BY AWARD TYPE AND PURPOSE defines the categories of awards subject to the revised policy and the infrastructure charge they are assessed.\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY TO FUND TRANSFERS defines the types of fund transfers that are assessed the infrastructure charge. (file updated 9/26/2008)\nThe schedule FUND TRANSFERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE defines the fund transfer General Ledger codes subject to the infrastructure charge.\nExample \u2013 Fund Transfer and Infrastructure \u2013 An example of a fund transfer from a gift to an operating budget.\nThe schedule BURDEN EXPENDITURE TYPE MAPPING SCHEDULE defines the expenditure types subject to the infrastructure charge. The new ISC charge is applied to most expenditure types.\nThe schedule INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGE EXPENDITURE TYPES/GENERAL LEDGER CODES defines the expenditure types and general ledger codes where the infrastructure assessment will appear.\nInfrastructure Exemptions and Waivers\nAny exceptions to the revised ISC Policy require approval of both the Provost and CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all. If the source of funds, typically a donor or sponsor, will not pay the infrastructure charge, the department or office may request to pay the charge themselves by applying to the Budget Office for permission to use an alternate PTA (project/task/award). Departments must use the \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form. The alternate source of funds must be able to support an expense of this nature. Designated, endowment income or expendable funds may be used. Sponsored projects may not be used. See additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects and exemptions below. If the exemption is not granted by the Provost and the Chief Financial Officer, the funds must be refused.\nAny questions about requesting a waiver to the ISC Policy should be directed to Dana Shelley in the Budget Office at ext 5-1256.\nA waiver of F&A (indirect costs) granted by the Dean of Research does not waive infrastructure.\nInfrastructure and Sponsored Projects\nThe revised Infrastructure Charge Policy applies to sponsored project awards assessed an F&A rate of 0%. Awards with F& A rates between 0% and 8% are not charged infrastructure but instead are charged their negotiated F&A rates.\nHowever, all sponsored projects awards with award start dates prior to 9/01/05 and awards made in response to previously-submitted sponsored projects proposals will continue to be subject to the prior ISC policy until the end of their competitive segment. At the time these projects are renewed, funding must be requested using the revised ISC guidelines.\nSponsored project awards are subject to the revised Infrastructure Charge Policy as follows:\nThe infrastructure charge is waived on all U.S. government - funded sponsored project awards. This includes awards directly funded by a federal, state or local governmental agency and awards that are funded on a \u201cflow-through\u201d basis using government monies.\nThe infrastructure charge is exempted (e.g., an alternate PTA is provided by the PI/department to pay the ISC charge) on all non-government sponsored project awards where the sponsor has a written policy stating that it does not pay indirect costs.\nEffective 9/1/05, if a sponsor/program is not waived or exempted under the rules listed above, the PI/administering department must include the infrastructure charge in their proposal/budget request to the sponsor. Institutional officials are responsible for reviewing proposals to make sure that the charge has been included, prior to endorsing the proposal on behalf of Stanford, or that an approved \u201cexemption\u201d (see below) is on file.\nIf a sponsor/program is not exempted as outlined above, the department may request to pay the infrastructure via an alternate PTA by submitting a \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form to the Provost Office. Exemptions must be approved in advance of submission of a proposal.\nUnobligated funds remaining at the expiration of a fixed price sponsored project that are transferred to a departmental PTA on or after September 1, 1999, are not subject to the infrastructure charge provided the funds were assessed an F&A rate of 8% or greater. These funds are transferred to a departmental PTA, less the facilities and administrative costs (formerly referred to as indirect costs) that would have been assessed on additional project expenditures.\nInstitutional allowances associated with fellowships are exempt from infrastructure. Best practices recommend the institutional allowance should be spent on the sponsored award. However, the schools and departments may transfer the allowance to an existing PTA where the expenditure will not be assessed infrastructure. Please contact your OSR representative for additional guidance.\nFor questions about infrastructure charge policy, exemptions or waivers, contact Dana Shelley. For questions related to sponsored projects please contact Vrinda Gopal. For all other inquiries, please call your Fund Accounting representative or the Manager of Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office.\nSIP \nThe Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) consists of projects and programs proposed and developed for the betterment and general support of the University's academic community and its physical plant. The infrastructure system directly supports the academic missions of teaching and research and the overall vitality of the institution. This infrastructure will be developed as necessary to improve public safety and service and to promote conservation in land use and resources.\nFor more information on SIP go to Administrative Guide Memo 8.3.1.\nNon-Sponsored Receivables Rates Table\nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY24 (Predetermined)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY23 (Predetermined)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t\nFY 22 (FINAL)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY 21 (FINAL)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY20\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY19\t56.5%\t8%*\t56.5%\t\nNon-Sponsored Receivables Rates before FY19 \nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY 18\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY17\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY16\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY15\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 14\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 13\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY12\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY11\t8%\t0%\t58% (2a)\t\nFY10\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY09\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY08\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY07\t8%\t0%\t56.5%\t\nFY06\t8%\t0%\t56%\t\nFY05\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY04\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nNotes \n*The FY 2023 and 2024 Stanford Affiliate Rate for Stanford Affiliate external customers/users remains at 8% Total Direct Costs for service centers, cores/shared facilities in departments, schools, labs, institutes, and centers.

Forms of payment include, but are not limited to, credit or debit card and electronic check processing. It generally requires a level of technical support and knowledge to create a secure website that can display the goods and services available for purchase, and safely capture restricted customer payment information during the purchase process. \nAs a first course of action, review the third-party service providers who are centrally supported and acceptable for deployment on campus. For new vendors, learn more about the criteria and steps for a Third-Party Vendor Evaluation. Do not use unapproved e-commerce vendors.\nTo be able to accept credit card payments on your website, and bearing in mind that credit card data is \u201chigh risk\u201d data, you will need the following:\nE-commerce Website\nConnects the merchant\u2019s web-based store with the acquirer (or its processor), card networks and card issuers. Specifically, your website will need to incorporate the following components:\nSSL Certificate: Secure Socket Layers (SSL) are services that encrypt data communicated online to provide security against unauthorized use. The SSL is identified by the \u201cs\u201d in the \u201chttps\u201d at the beginning of the URL of a SSL-protected webpage and often colors the URL bar.\nOnline Store/Shopping Cart: Software that collects and organizes online customers\u2019 list of items for purchase. Once the customer is ready to check out, the shopping cart calculates the order total and presents the customer with a payment information form to complete the transaction. The shopping cart can be provided by third party vendors or be custom-built by website developers.\nPayment Gateway: Technology that connects a merchant's online store/shopping cart with its acquirer (or processor) and transmits the transaction information and authorization for each customer purchase.\nE-Commerce Merchant Account\nEstablishing a merchant account is the mechanism that enables merchants to accept credit and debit cards for payment. It is provided by the university\u2019s acquiring bank Wells Fargo. It links all of the above mentioned components into an integrated system. For more information, refer to Topic Overview: Merchant Account Life Cycle.\nThe university encourages departments to use CyberSource payment gateway. By using CyberSource's Secure Acceptance Web/Mobile implementation, the customer enters their cardholder information onto a secure order page hosted by CyberSource. In this way, no credit card data is stored upon or transmitted through any of Stanford's UIT systems or servers.\nIf merchants choose another third party provided payment gateway, they will need to ensure that first the gateway is fully approved by Merchant Services (MS) and is compatible with Wells Fargo\u2019s processor - First Data.\nCyberSource can also be integrated with other third-party, vendor-provided applications if the vendors offer integration capability. Timelines, pricing and fees are dependent upon vendor and integration requirements. E-commerce merchants that connect to CyberSource are responsible for monitoring/maintaining that connection. All connections must be fully documented and that documentation must be submitted to MS prior to the merchant's web store going live with processing the live transactions.\nThe following CyberSource features are available to merchants:\nCyberSource Secure Acceptance Web/Mobile: Used to enable your web store to accept card and check payments by customers entering their own information into a secure order page hosted by Cybersource.\nRecurring Billing/Customer Profiles: Enables you to create customer profiles that are stored on CyberSource\u2019s secure servers. A customer profile is a set of information about a customer that you store in the CyberSource database for future billing.\nSecure Storage: Customer payment information is securely stored for each transaction.\nNote: Not all features may be applicable to your web store.\nE-commerce merchants who use CyberSource can contact them directly via the Customer Support Center. The support center allows live chat, submit a ticket, and call for phone support. \nAny significant changes to current processes planned by currently active e-commerce merchants must be reviewed and approved by MS prior to implementation. Such changes include (but are not limited to):\nDepartmental website\nApplication software\nProducts or services for sale\nAnticipated transaction volume\nDepartmental contacts responsible for the e-commerce \nStanford-managed Stripe accounts offer ecommerce products for merchants to choose from that do not rely on a third-party ISV or the development of a custom implementation. These core payment methods have wide applicability to that Stanford merchant community. See the Stripe Payment Solutions page for more information on:\nStripe payment methods\nNative Stripe solutions available for merchants\nBasic Stripe setup for merchants: products, coupons, etc.\nCreating and using Payment Links\nUsing Invoicing\nStripe integrations\nIntegrating Stripe into workflows\nCardinalPay is a single-source solution for managing Stanford-managed Stripe accounts, offering front-end payment acceptance and back-end account management. Merchant Services offers consulting services to Stanford merchants. See the Resource: CardinalPay page for more information.\nPlease submit a support request for help integrating Stripe with your business needs.\nWhile it is perfectly acceptable or encouraged for customers to make online payments from their personal devices, merchants must not allow customers to enter their credit card information on any university owned device (computer, tablet, laptop).\nIf merchants have the need to manually enter card information into an e-commerce site on behalf of the customer, entries must be made through an approved secure channel. This may include a dedicated PCI workstation or at a regular workstation connected with the approved point-to-point-encryption (P2PE), secure reading and exchange of data (SRED) key. Contact the Merchant Services team for more information.\nIn order to comply with Visa and MasterCard regulations, certain terms and conditions must be presented on university websites and/or mobile apps. These include:\nName of business unit listed on your merchant ID or payment processing account\nContact information such as mailing address, phone number and/or email address\nClear and prominent display of the merchant outlet\u2019s country of operation, appearing: \nOn the same screen view as the checkout screen that presents the final transaction amount\nWithin the sequence of webpages the cardholder will access during the checkout process\nDisclosure of return, refund and cancellation policies on the sequence pages before final checkout and include a \u201cclick to accept\u201d button, checkbox or other acknowledgement.\nWork with MS for all your e-commerce needs\nAllow plenty of time to establish your Merchant ID and e-commerce implementation (minimum 1 to 3 months depending on the solution)\nInform MS of changes to staff and access roles so that payment maintenance of gateway users can be properly managed\nDo not conduct e-commerce at Stanford without an official Merchant ID unless exception approval is obtained\nReview the third-party service providers who are centrally supported and acceptable for deployment on campus. For new vendors, learn more about the criteria and steps for a Third-Party Vendor Evaluation. Do not use unapproved e-commerce vendors."}

The largest program included in the supplemental rate is the tuition grant program (TGP). Also included are university-wide programs that benefit faculty and staff. Please contact Neil Hamilton at neil.hamilton@stanford.edu of the University Budget Office for questions related to the TGP and supplemental rate.\nTuition Grant Program Fringe Rate\nFringe Benefit rates do not include the Tuition Grant Program fringe rate. The Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTAs including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs. The TGP rate is applied to regular benefits eligible employee salaries paid by non-government sponsors in addition to the fringe benefit rate. The TGP rate contributes to the University's fund for continuation of the Tuition Grant Program for children of faculty and staff. For further information on the TGP rate, please contact the University Budget Office.\nNote 2: Starting Sept. 1, 2022, Stanford increased the subsidy for Cardinal Care health insurance from 50% to 100% for graduate students who are supported on research and teaching assistantships at 25% level or higher (or fellowships at a comparable level) and who are in good academic standing. RAs and TAs with a <25% appointment will receive a 50% subsidy.\nTo fund the increased subsidy for RAs/TAs, an additional supplemental fringe rate is charged on graduate RA/TA salaries as a separate item on a different expenditure type (ET 51785). However, to protect sponsored research budgets, this supplemental rate is only charged on non\u2010sponsored PTAs.\nFull accounting details for these expenses including can be found on the Fingate website under Accounting for Increased Graduate Cardinal Care Subsidy.\nMore information about the Cardinal Care subsidy can be found on the Financial Aid Office website.\nHow Fringe Rates are Calculated \nStanford uses multiple fringe benefits rates developed under the requirements of 2 CFR 200). Since September 1, 2002, Stanford has used four different rates for different categories of employees, as described below.\nEach rate is calculated by the development of a pool of fringe benefits costs (the numerator) and of a salary and wage base (denominator). The pool consists of costs for the benefits provided to a particular category of employees. When the pool is divided by the base applicable to that category of employees, a rate results; this rate represents the percentage that must be added to employees\u2019 salary and wage dollars.\nThe categories of employees having separate fringe benefits rates are as follows: 1. Regular Benefits-Eligible Employees; 2. Post-Doctoral Affiliates; 3. Contingent (casual or temporary) Employees; and 4. Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants. (Other student salaries have a benefits rate of zero.)\nRegular benefits-eligible employees are those faculty and staff who hold an appointment of at least six months (four months for bargaining unit employees) for at least 50% time and thus are eligible for Stanford\u2019s retirement and health and welfare benefits programs. Post-doctoral affiliates are advanced nonmatriculating students employed by Stanford to perform services related primarily to Stanford research projects. Contingent employees are those whose appointments are too brief (i.e., less than six months, or four months for bargaining unit employees) or too few hours (i.e., less than 50% time) to make them eligible for regular benefits. Graduate research and teaching assistants (RAs and TAs) are students whose RA or TA appointments are at least 25% (for the full University contribution to the cost of student health insurance) or 10% (for a half contribution by the University).\nRegular benefits-eligible salaries charged to government-funded PTA\u2019s, academic service centers and sponsored project cost sharing PTA\u2019s are exempt from the TGP charge.\nThe TGP charge is subject to facilities and administrative costs (F&A) and infrastructure charges. The TGP charge appears in expenditure type 51770 FRINGE BENEFITS TGP.\nIf you have any questions or need more information about the application of the TGP Fringe Benefit Rate, please contact the University Budget Office or, Research Administration Policy and Compliance, at extension 3-9102.\nOther registered Stanford undergraduate and graduate students have no benefits charges applied against their wages; this is because these students receive no fringe benefits. Students who are employed by the University during a quarter in which they are not registered (including summer quarter) must be classified as contingent employees until they are registered again.\nThe fringe benefits pool comprises the following categories of cost:\nRETIREMENT PROGRAMS, including social security, contributory plans, early retirement incentive programs, etc.\nINSURANCE PROGRAMS, including health, dental, group life, disability, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation, post-employment medical, travel insurance, and other.\nMISCELLANEOUS PROGRAMS, including staff development, severance pay, sabbaticals, benefits counseling, etc.\nTUITION GRANT PROGRAMS (TGP), for children of eligible faculty and staff, was included in the negotiated fringe benefits pool through Fiscal Year 1999, but has since been distributed by means of a separate charge against non-government salaries only.\nThe salary bases for fringe benefits consist of all salaries and wages paid to each category of employee. Sabbatical and long-term disability payments, which are themselves fringe benefits, are not included in any salary base.\nStanford\u2019s fringe benefits rates are established under 2 CFR 200., \u201cNegotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions,\u201d which provide for the negotiation of fixed rates in advance for a fiscal year. Any over- or under-recovery for that year is included as an adjustment to the appropriate fringe benefits rate for a subsequent year.\nTuition Grant Program\nThe University applies the TGP rate to regular benefits-eligible salaries to support the costs of the Tuition Grant Program (Admin Guide Memo 2.3.3, \"Tuition Privileges\").\nEffective September 1, 1999, the Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTA\u2019s including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs.\nRate Agreements \nFY24 Fixed Staff Benefits Rate agreement with ONR.

The vacation accrual/DSL rates will be charged at the time of the salary expenditure. No salary will be charged to the award when the employee is on vacation.\"\nThese rates do not apply to SLAC\n\nAbout \nStanford provides vacation to its regular staff employees. The accrual rates enable Stanford to charge the appropriate funding source for the vacation earned by benefits-eligible staff as they are working. The rates will charge vacation as it is earned, rather than as it is taken. Application of the rates will build a central university fund to pay for vacation salary when staff either take vacation or leave the University.\nFor more information on how Vacation Accrual and/or Disability Sick Leave rates will impact a sponsored award, visit the ORA Budgets and Budget Justifications webpage.\nNOTE: Faculty members do not accrue vacation leave or sick leave. Short absences for personal business, illness, jury duty, military duty, and similarly limited absences normally are with full salary.

The subsidy appears on expenditure statements in expenditure type 57640 GS Health Insurance Recovery. The financial system automatically applies the surcharge to eligible transactions in the form of a rate.\nBoth the surcharge and RA/TA fringe subsidize eligible graduate student Cardinal Care health insurance. The Provost\u2019s Office reviews and adjusts the GSS rate as necessary each fiscal year. \nExpenditure Types Subject to GSS\nExp Type\tDescription\t\n57340\tGFS STANDARD CHGS\t\n57510\n57520\n\t\nGRADUATE STUDENT STIPEND\nGFS GRD STU SUPPLY TRAVEL STPD\n\t\nIn general, stipend payments (charged to the expenditure types listed above) from Stanford operating budget PTAs, or from School or Department PTAs, will be assessed the GSS rate. \nAll fellowships awarded by external sources, where the awards, projects and tasks are established by the Office of Sponsored Research are EXCLUDED from the application of this surcharge (award range PAAAA-VZZZZ). In addition, no GSS is applied on cost sharing PTAs, miscellaneous receivables, capital projects, service centers or auxiliaries.\nFellowship stipends paid to Postdoctoral Scholars (expenditure type 57840) and to non-matriculated students including Visiting Researchers (expenditure type 57860) are NOT charged the GSS rate, as neither of these groups receives a Cardinal Care subsidy.\nInstitutional Allowances\nSome externally-funded fellowships, such as NIH Training Grants or NSF Fellowships, provide an institutional allowance for the benefit of the fellow. This allowance is exempt from GSS. When the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) transfers this allowance to a departmental PTA, the PTA is exempt from the GSS surcharge. Expenditures subject/not subject to GSS should not be commingled in the same PTA.\nImplementing Infrastructure \nImplementing the Revised Infrastructure Charge (ISC) Policy More information about this policy can be found in the Stanford Administrative Guide 8.3.1\nAugust 31, 2005\tRev: November 8, 2010\t\nThe Board of Trustees of Stanford University approved a revised infrastructure policy in October 2004.The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge from 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted funds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry an F&A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or transferred.\nGifts for building projects are waived from the infrastructure charges. Gifts of donated capital equipment are waived from infrastructure. However, restricted funds used to purchase capital equipment will be assessed ISC.\nThe infrastructure charge collected from non formula schools will be credited 75% to a central university PFOO (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central PFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected from formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO belonging to the formula school or auxiliary.\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all.\nThis guide provides additional detail implementing Administrative Guide Memo 3.3.1 Infrastructure Charges.\nInfrastructure Charge\nAwards are subject to the revised infrastructure policy as follows (see additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects below):\nDesignated funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on revenue in General Ledger codes 43xxx, 44xxx and 46xxx. The charge will appear on the fund statement only in General Ledger codes 48990 or 48992. \nExpendable gift and endowment income funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures and fund transfers including transfers to operating budgets and designated funds. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935 on the expenditure statement. The charge on fund transfers will appear in General Ledger codes 49710 or 49720 on the fund statement only. Expendable gift and endowment income funds marked \"Donor Exempt\" prior to September 1, 2005 are waived from infrastructure. All other expendable gift and endowment income funds are subject to the revised infrastructure policy.\nNon-government and foreign government sponsored project awards are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935.\nOperating budgets, budget pools, service centers, auxiliaries, miscellaneous receivables, reserves, pending funds, U.S. government sponsored projects, University Research, plant, student loans, agency and living trust funds/awards and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are waived from infrastructure by the revised policy.\nThe utility charge is discontinued.\nThe following schedules define the revised infrastructure process in detail:\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE (ISC) POLICY BY AWARD TYPE AND PURPOSE defines the categories of awards subject to the revised policy and the infrastructure charge they are assessed.\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY TO FUND TRANSFERS defines the types of fund transfers that are assessed the infrastructure charge. (file updated 9/26/2008)\nThe schedule FUND TRANSFERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE defines the fund transfer General Ledger codes subject to the infrastructure charge.\nExample \u2013 Fund Transfer and Infrastructure \u2013 An example of a fund transfer from a gift to an operating budget.\nThe schedule BURDEN EXPENDITURE TYPE MAPPING SCHEDULE defines the expenditure types subject to the infrastructure charge. The new ISC charge is applied to most expenditure types.\nThe schedule INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGE EXPENDITURE TYPES/GENERAL LEDGER CODES defines the expenditure types and general ledger codes where the infrastructure assessment will appear.\nInfrastructure Exemptions and Waivers\nAny exceptions to the revised ISC Policy require approval of both the Provost and CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all. If the source of funds, typically a donor or sponsor, will not pay the infrastructure charge, the department or office may request to pay the charge themselves by applying to the Budget Office for permission to use an alternate PTA (project/task/award). Departments must use the \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form. The alternate source of funds must be able to support an expense of this nature. Designated, endowment income or expendable funds may be used. Sponsored projects may not be used. See additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects and exemptions below. If the exemption is not granted by the Provost and the Chief Financial Officer, the funds must be refused.\nAny questions about requesting a waiver to the ISC Policy should be directed to Dana Shelley in the Budget Office at ext 5-1256.\nA waiver of F&A (indirect costs) granted by the Dean of Research does not waive infrastructure.\nInfrastructure and Sponsored Projects\nThe revised Infrastructure Charge Policy applies to sponsored project awards assessed an F&A rate of 0%. Awards with F& A rates between 0% and 8% are not charged infrastructure but instead are charged their negotiated F&A rates.\nHowever, all sponsored projects awards with award start dates prior to 9/01/05 and awards made in response to previously-submitted sponsored projects proposals will continue to be subject to the prior ISC policy until the end of their competitive segment. At the time these projects are renewed, funding must be requested using the revised ISC guidelines.\nSponsored project awards are subject to the revised Infrastructure Charge Policy as follows:\nThe infrastructure charge is waived on all U.S. government - funded sponsored project awards. This includes awards directly funded by a federal, state or local governmental agency and awards that are funded on a \u201cflow-through\u201d basis using government monies.\nThe infrastructure charge is exempted (e.g., an alternate PTA is provided by the PI/department to pay the ISC charge) on all non-government sponsored project awards where the sponsor has a written policy stating that it does not pay indirect costs.\nEffective 9/1/05, if a sponsor/program is not waived or exempted under the rules listed above, the PI/administering department must include the infrastructure charge in their proposal/budget request to the sponsor. Institutional officials are responsible for reviewing proposals to make sure that the charge has been included, prior to endorsing the proposal on behalf of Stanford, or that an approved \u201cexemption\u201d (see below) is on file.\nIf a sponsor/program is not exempted as outlined above, the department may request to pay the infrastructure via an alternate PTA by submitting a \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form to the Provost Office. Exemptions must be approved in advance of submission of a proposal.\nUnobligated funds remaining at the expiration of a fixed price sponsored project that are transferred to a departmental PTA on or after September 1, 1999, are not subject to the infrastructure charge provided the funds were assessed an F&A rate of 8% or greater. These funds are transferred to a departmental PTA, less the facilities and administrative costs (formerly referred to as indirect costs) that would have been assessed on additional project expenditures.\nInstitutional allowances associated with fellowships are exempt from infrastructure. Best practices recommend the institutional allowance should be spent on the sponsored award. However, the schools and departments may transfer the allowance to an existing PTA where the expenditure will not be assessed infrastructure. Please contact your OSR representative for additional guidance.\nFor questions about infrastructure charge policy, exemptions or waivers, contact Dana Shelley. For questions related to sponsored projects please contact Vrinda Gopal.

The largest program included in the supplemental rate is the tuition grant program (TGP). Also included are university-wide programs that benefit faculty and staff. Please contact Neil Hamilton at neil.hamilton@stanford.edu of the University Budget Office for questions related to the TGP and supplemental rate.\nTuition Grant Program Fringe Rate\nFringe Benefit rates do not include the Tuition Grant Program fringe rate. The Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTAs including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs. The TGP rate is applied to regular benefits eligible employee salaries paid by non-government sponsors in addition to the fringe benefit rate. The TGP rate contributes to the University's fund for continuation of the Tuition Grant Program for children of faculty and staff. For further information on the TGP rate, please contact the University Budget Office.\nNote 2: Starting Sept. 1, 2022, Stanford increased the subsidy for Cardinal Care health insurance from 50% to 100% for graduate students who are supported on research and teaching assistantships at 25% level or higher (or fellowships at a comparable level) and who are in good academic standing. RAs and TAs with a <25% appointment will receive a 50% subsidy.\nTo fund the increased subsidy for RAs/TAs, an additional supplemental fringe rate is charged on graduate RA/TA salaries as a separate item on a different expenditure type (ET 51785). However, to protect sponsored research budgets, this supplemental rate is only charged on non\u2010sponsored PTAs.\nFull accounting details for these expenses including can be found on the Fingate website under Accounting for Increased Graduate Cardinal Care Subsidy.\nMore information about the Cardinal Care subsidy can be found on the Financial Aid Office website.\nHow Fringe Rates are Calculated \nStanford uses multiple fringe benefits rates developed under the requirements of 2 CFR 200). Since September 1, 2002, Stanford has used four different rates for different categories of employees, as described below.\nEach rate is calculated by the development of a pool of fringe benefits costs (the numerator) and of a salary and wage base (denominator). The pool consists of costs for the benefits provided to a particular category of employees. When the pool is divided by the base applicable to that category of employees, a rate results; this rate represents the percentage that must be added to employees\u2019 salary and wage dollars.\nThe categories of employees having separate fringe benefits rates are as follows: 1. Regular Benefits-Eligible Employees; 2. Post-Doctoral Affiliates; 3. Contingent (casual or temporary) Employees; and 4. Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants. (Other student salaries have a benefits rate of zero.)\nRegular benefits-eligible employees are those faculty and staff who hold an appointment of at least six months (four months for bargaining unit employees) for at least 50% time and thus are eligible for Stanford\u2019s retirement and health and welfare benefits programs. Post-doctoral affiliates are advanced nonmatriculating students employed by Stanford to perform services related primarily to Stanford research projects. Contingent employees are those whose appointments are too brief (i.e., less than six months, or four months for bargaining unit employees) or too few hours (i.e., less than 50% time) to make them eligible for regular benefits. Graduate research and teaching assistants (RAs and TAs) are students whose RA or TA appointments are at least 25% (for the full University contribution to the cost of student health insurance) or 10% (for a half contribution by the University).\nRegular benefits-eligible salaries charged to government-funded PTA\u2019s, academic service centers and sponsored project cost sharing PTA\u2019s are exempt from the TGP charge.\nThe TGP charge is subject to facilities and administrative costs (F&A) and infrastructure charges. The TGP charge appears in expenditure type 51770 FRINGE BENEFITS TGP.\nIf you have any questions or need more information about the application of the TGP Fringe Benefit Rate, please contact the University Budget Office or, Research Administration Policy and Compliance, at extension 3-9102.\nOther registered Stanford undergraduate and graduate students have no benefits charges applied against their wages; this is because these students receive no fringe benefits. Students who are employed by the University during a quarter in which they are not registered (including summer quarter) must be classified as contingent employees until they are registered again.\nThe fringe benefits pool comprises the following categories of cost:\nRETIREMENT PROGRAMS, including social security, contributory plans, early retirement incentive programs, etc.\nINSURANCE PROGRAMS, including health, dental, group life, disability, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation, post-employment medical, travel insurance, and other.\nMISCELLANEOUS PROGRAMS, including staff development, severance pay, sabbaticals, benefits counseling, etc.\nTUITION GRANT PROGRAMS (TGP), for children of eligible faculty and staff, was included in the negotiated fringe benefits pool through Fiscal Year 1999, but has since been distributed by means of a separate charge against non-government salaries only.\nThe salary bases for fringe benefits consist of all salaries and wages paid to each category of employee. Sabbatical and long-term disability payments, which are themselves fringe benefits, are not included in any salary base.\nStanford\u2019s fringe benefits rates are established under 2 CFR 200., \u201cNegotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions,\u201d which provide for the negotiation of fixed rates in advance for a fiscal year. Any over- or under-recovery for that year is included as an adjustment to the appropriate fringe benefits rate for a subsequent year.\nTuition Grant Program\nThe University applies the TGP rate to regular benefits-eligible salaries to support the costs of the Tuition Grant Program (Admin Guide Memo 2.3.3, \"Tuition Privileges\").\nEffective September 1, 1999, the Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTA\u2019s including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs.\nRate Agreements \nFY24 Fixed Staff Benefits Rate agreement with ONR.

The vacation accrual/DSL rates will be charged at the time of the salary expenditure. No salary will be charged to the award when the employee is on vacation.\"\nThese rates do not apply to SLAC\n\nAbout \nStanford provides vacation to its regular staff employees. The accrual rates enable Stanford to charge the appropriate funding source for the vacation earned by benefits-eligible staff as they are working. The rates will charge vacation as it is earned, rather than as it is taken. Application of the rates will build a central university fund to pay for vacation salary when staff either take vacation or leave the University.\nFor more information on how Vacation Accrual and/or Disability Sick Leave rates will impact a sponsored award, visit the ORA Budgets and Budget Justifications webpage.\nNOTE: Faculty members do not accrue vacation leave or sick leave. Short absences for personal business, illness, jury duty, military duty, and similarly limited absences normally are with full salary.

The subsidy appears on expenditure statements in expenditure type 57640 GS Health Insurance Recovery. The financial system automatically applies the surcharge to eligible transactions in the form of a rate.\nBoth the surcharge and RA/TA fringe subsidize eligible graduate student Cardinal Care health insurance. The Provost\u2019s Office reviews and adjusts the GSS rate as necessary each fiscal year. \nExpenditure Types Subject to GSS\nExp Type\tDescription\t\n57340\tGFS STANDARD CHGS\t\n57510\n57520\n\t\nGRADUATE STUDENT STIPEND\nGFS GRD STU SUPPLY TRAVEL STPD\n\t\nIn general, stipend payments (charged to the expenditure types listed above) from Stanford operating budget PTAs, or from School or Department PTAs, will be assessed the GSS rate. \nAll fellowships awarded by external sources, where the awards, projects and tasks are established by the Office of Sponsored Research are EXCLUDED from the application of this surcharge (award range PAAAA-VZZZZ). In addition, no GSS is applied on cost sharing PTAs, miscellaneous receivables, capital projects, service centers or auxiliaries.\nFellowship stipends paid to Postdoctoral Scholars (expenditure type 57840) and to non-matriculated students including Visiting Researchers (expenditure type 57860) are NOT charged the GSS rate, as neither of these groups receives a Cardinal Care subsidy.\nInstitutional Allowances\nSome externally-funded fellowships, such as NIH Training Grants or NSF Fellowships, provide an institutional allowance for the benefit of the fellow. This allowance is exempt from GSS. When the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) transfers this allowance to a departmental PTA, the PTA is exempt from the GSS surcharge. Expenditures subject/not subject to GSS should not be commingled in the same PTA.\nImplementing Infrastructure \nImplementing the Revised Infrastructure Charge (ISC) Policy More information about this policy can be found in the Stanford Administrative Guide 8.3.1\nAugust 31, 2005\tRev: November 8, 2010\t\nThe Board of Trustees of Stanford University approved a revised infrastructure policy in October 2004.The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge from 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted funds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry an F&A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or transferred.\nGifts for building projects are waived from the infrastructure charges. Gifts of donated capital equipment are waived from infrastructure. However, restricted funds used to purchase capital equipment will be assessed ISC.\nThe infrastructure charge collected from non formula schools will be credited 75% to a central university PFOO (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central PFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected from formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO belonging to the formula school or auxiliary.\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all.\nThis guide provides additional detail implementing Administrative Guide Memo 3.3.1 Infrastructure Charges.\nInfrastructure Charge\nAwards are subject to the revised infrastructure policy as follows (see additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects below):\nDesignated funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on revenue in General Ledger codes 43xxx, 44xxx and 46xxx. The charge will appear on the fund statement only in General Ledger codes 48990 or 48992. \nExpendable gift and endowment income funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures and fund transfers including transfers to operating budgets and designated funds. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935 on the expenditure statement. The charge on fund transfers will appear in General Ledger codes 49710 or 49720 on the fund statement only. Expendable gift and endowment income funds marked \"Donor Exempt\" prior to September 1, 2005 are waived from infrastructure. All other expendable gift and endowment income funds are subject to the revised infrastructure policy.\nNon-government and foreign government sponsored project awards are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935.\nOperating budgets, budget pools, service centers, auxiliaries, miscellaneous receivables, reserves, pending funds, U.S. government sponsored projects, University Research, plant, student loans, agency and living trust funds/awards and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are waived from infrastructure by the revised policy.\nThe utility charge is discontinued.\nThe following schedules define the revised infrastructure process in detail:\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE (ISC) POLICY BY AWARD TYPE AND PURPOSE defines the categories of awards subject to the revised policy and the infrastructure charge they are assessed.\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY TO FUND TRANSFERS defines the types of fund transfers that are assessed the infrastructure charge. (file updated 9/26/2008)\nThe schedule FUND TRANSFERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE defines the fund transfer General Ledger codes subject to the infrastructure charge.\nExample \u2013 Fund Transfer and Infrastructure \u2013 An example of a fund transfer from a gift to an operating budget.\nThe schedule BURDEN EXPENDITURE TYPE MAPPING SCHEDULE defines the expenditure types subject to the infrastructure charge. The new ISC charge is applied to most expenditure types.\nThe schedule INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGE EXPENDITURE TYPES/GENERAL LEDGER CODES defines the expenditure types and general ledger codes where the infrastructure assessment will appear.\nInfrastructure Exemptions and Waivers\nAny exceptions to the revised ISC Policy require approval of both the Provost and CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all. If the source of funds, typically a donor or sponsor, will not pay the infrastructure charge, the department or office may request to pay the charge themselves by applying to the Budget Office for permission to use an alternate PTA (project/task/award). Departments must use the \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form. The alternate source of funds must be able to support an expense of this nature. Designated, endowment income or expendable funds may be used. Sponsored projects may not be used. See additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects and exemptions below. If the exemption is not granted by the Provost and the Chief Financial Officer, the funds must be refused.\nAny questions about requesting a waiver to the ISC Policy should be directed to Dana Shelley in the Budget Office at ext 5-1256.\nA waiver of F&A (indirect costs) granted by the Dean of Research does not waive infrastructure.\nInfrastructure and Sponsored Projects\nThe revised Infrastructure Charge Policy applies to sponsored project awards assessed an F&A rate of 0%. Awards with F& A rates between 0% and 8% are not charged infrastructure but instead are charged their negotiated F&A rates.\nHowever, all sponsored projects awards with award start dates prior to 9/01/05 and awards made in response to previously-submitted sponsored projects proposals will continue to be subject to the prior ISC policy until the end of their competitive segment. At the time these projects are renewed, funding must be requested using the revised ISC guidelines.\nSponsored project awards are subject to the revised Infrastructure Charge Policy as follows:\nThe infrastructure charge is waived on all U.S. government - funded sponsored project awards. This includes awards directly funded by a federal, state or local governmental agency and awards that are funded on a \u201cflow-through\u201d basis using government monies.\nThe infrastructure charge is exempted (e.g., an alternate PTA is provided by the PI/department to pay the ISC charge) on all non-government sponsored project awards where the sponsor has a written policy stating that it does not pay indirect costs.\nEffective 9/1/05, if a sponsor/program is not waived or exempted under the rules listed above, the PI/administering department must include the infrastructure charge in their proposal/budget request to the sponsor. Institutional officials are responsible for reviewing proposals to make sure that the charge has been included, prior to endorsing the proposal on behalf of Stanford, or that an approved \u201cexemption\u201d (see below) is on file.\nIf a sponsor/program is not exempted as outlined above, the department may request to pay the infrastructure via an alternate PTA by submitting a \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form to the Provost Office. Exemptions must be approved in advance of submission of a proposal.\nUnobligated funds remaining at the expiration of a fixed price sponsored project that are transferred to a departmental PTA on or after September 1, 1999, are not subject to the infrastructure charge provided the funds were assessed an F&A rate of 8% or greater. These funds are transferred to a departmental PTA, less the facilities and administrative costs (formerly referred to as indirect costs) that would have been assessed on additional project expenditures.\nInstitutional allowances associated with fellowships are exempt from infrastructure. Best practices recommend the institutional allowance should be spent on the sponsored award. However, the schools and departments may transfer the allowance to an existing PTA where the expenditure will not be assessed infrastructure. Please contact your OSR representative for additional guidance.\nFor questions about infrastructure charge policy, exemptions or waivers, contact Dana Shelley. For questions related to sponsored projects please contact Vrinda Gopal. For all other inquiries, please call your Fund Accounting representative or the Manager of Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office.\nSIP \nThe Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) consists of projects and programs proposed and developed for the betterment and general support of the University's academic community and its physical plant. The infrastructure system directly supports the academic missions of teaching and research and the overall vitality of the institution. This infrastructure will be developed as necessary to improve public safety and service and to promote conservation in land use and resources.\nFor more information on SIP go to Administrative Guide Memo 8.3.1.\nNon-Sponsored Receivables Rates Table\nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY24 (Predetermined)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY23 (Predetermined)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t\nFY 22 (FINAL)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY 21 (FINAL)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY20\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY19\t56.5%\t8%*\t56.5%\t\nNon-Sponsored Receivables Rates before FY19 \nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY 18\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY17\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY16\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY15\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 14\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 13\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY12\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY11\t8%\t0%\t58% (2a)\t\nFY10\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY09\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY08\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY07\t8%\t0%\t56.5%\t\nFY06\t8%\t0%\t56%\t\nFY05\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY04\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nNotes \n*The FY 2023 and 2024 Stanford Affiliate Rate for Stanford Affiliate external customers/users remains at 8% Total Direct Costs for service centers, cores/shared facilities in departments, schools, labs, institutes, and centers.

The largest program included in the supplemental rate is the tuition grant program (TGP). Also included are university-wide programs that benefit faculty and staff. Please contact Neil Hamilton at neil.hamilton@stanford.edu of the University Budget Office for questions related to the TGP and supplemental rate.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 6\nTuition Grant Program Fringe Rate\nFringe Benefit rates do not include the Tuition Grant Program fringe rate. The Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTAs including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs. The TGP rate is applied to regular benefits eligible employee salaries paid by non-government sponsors in addition to the fringe benefit rate. The TGP rate contributes to the University's fund for continuation of the Tuition Grant Program for children of faculty and staff. For further information on the TGP rate, please contact the University Budget Office.\nNote 2: Starting Sept. 1, 2022, Stanford increased the subsidy for Cardinal Care health insurance from 50% to 100% for graduate students who are supported on research and teaching assistantships at 25% level or higher (or fellowships at a comparable level) and who are in good academic standing. RAs and TAs with a <25% appointment will receive a 50% subsidy.\nTo fund the increased subsidy for RAs/TAs, an additional supplemental fringe rate is charged on graduate RA/TA salaries as a separate item on a different expenditure type (ET 51785). However, to protect sponsored research budgets, this supplemental rate is only charged on non\u2010sponsored PTAs.\nFull accounting details for these expenses including can be found on the Fingate website under Accounting for Increased Graduate Cardinal Care Subsidy.\nMore information about the Cardinal Care subsidy can be found on the Financial Aid Office website.\nHow Fringe Rates are Calculated \nStanford uses multiple fringe benefits rates developed under the requirements of 2 CFR 200). Since September 1, 2002, Stanford has used four different rates for different categories of employees, as described below.\nEach rate is calculated by the development of a pool of fringe benefits costs (the numerator) and of a salary and wage base (denominator). The pool consists of costs for the benefits provided to a particular category of employees. When the pool is divided by the base applicable to that category of employees, a rate results; this rate represents the percentage that must be added to employees\u2019 salary and wage dollars.\nThe categories of employees having separate fringe benefits rates are as follows: 1. Regular Benefits-Eligible Employees; 2. Post-Doctoral Affiliates; 3. Contingent (casual or temporary) Employees; and 4. Graduate Research and Teaching Assistants. (Other student salaries have a benefits rate of zero.)\nRegular benefits-eligible employees are those faculty and staff who hold an appointment of at least six months (four months for bargaining unit employees) for at least 50% time and thus are eligible for Stanford\u2019s retirement and health and welfare benefits programs. Post-doctoral affiliates are advanced nonmatriculating students employed by Stanford to perform services related primarily to Stanford research projects. Contingent employees are those whose appointments are too brief (i.e., less than six months, or four months for bargaining unit employees) or too few hours (i.e., less than 50% time) to make them eligible for regular benefits. Graduate research and teaching assistants (RAs and TAs) are students whose RA or TA appointments are at least 25% (for the full University contribution to the cost of student health insurance) or 10% (for a half contribution by the University).\nRegular benefits-eligible salaries charged to government-funded PTA\u2019s, academic service centers and sponsored project cost sharing PTA\u2019s are exempt from the TGP charge.\nThe TGP charge is subject to facilities and administrative costs (F&A) and infrastructure charges. The TGP charge appears in expenditure type 51770 FRINGE BENEFITS TGP.\nIf you have any questions or need more information about the application of the TGP Fringe Benefit Rate, please contact the University Budget Office or, Research Administration Policy and Compliance, at extension 3-9102.\nOther registered Stanford undergraduate and graduate students have no benefits charges applied against their wages; this is because these students receive no fringe benefits. Students who are employed by the University during a quarter in which they are not registered (including summer quarter) must be classified as contingent employees until they are registered again.\nThe fringe benefits pool comprises the following categories of cost:\nRETIREMENT PROGRAMS, including social security, contributory plans, early retirement incentive programs, etc.\nINSURANCE PROGRAMS, including health, dental, group life, disability, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation, post-employment medical, travel insurance, and other.\nMISCELLANEOUS PROGRAMS, including staff development, severance pay, sabbaticals, benefits counseling, etc.\nTUITION GRANT PROGRAMS (TGP), for children of eligible faculty and staff, was included in the negotiated fringe benefits pool through Fiscal Year 1999, but has since been distributed by means of a separate charge against non-government salaries only.\nThe salary bases for fringe benefits consist of all salaries and wages paid to each category of employee. Sabbatical and long-term disability payments, which are themselves fringe benefits, are not included in any salary base.\nStanford\u2019s fringe benefits rates are established under 2 CFR 200., \u201cNegotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions,\u201d which provide for the negotiation of fixed rates in advance for a fiscal year. Any over- or under-recovery for that year is included as an adjustment to the appropriate fringe benefits rate for a subsequent year.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 7\nTuition Grant Program\nThe University applies the TGP rate to regular benefits-eligible salaries to support the costs of the Tuition Grant Program (Admin Guide Memo 2.3.3, \"Tuition Privileges\").\nEffective September 1, 1999, the Tuition Grant Program (TGP) fringe rate is assessed on regular benefits-eligible salaries charged to all non-government funded PTA\u2019s including sponsored projects, operating budgets and auxiliary PTAs.\nRate Agreements \nFY24 Fixed Staff Benefits Rate agreement with ONR.

The Provost\u2019s Office reviews and adjusts the GSS rate as necessary each fiscal year. \nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 12\nExpenditure Types Subject to GSS\nExp Type\tDescription\t\n57340\tGFS STANDARD CHGS\t\n57510\n57520\n\t\nGRADUATE STUDENT STIPEND\nGFS GRD STU SUPPLY TRAVEL STPD\n\t\nIn general, stipend payments (charged to the expenditure types listed above) from Stanford operating budget PTAs, or from School or Department PTAs, will be assessed the GSS rate. \nAll fellowships awarded by external sources, where the awards, projects and tasks are established by the Office of Sponsored Research are EXCLUDED from the application of this surcharge (award range PAAAA-VZZZZ). In addition, no GSS is applied on cost sharing PTAs, miscellaneous receivables, capital projects, service centers or auxiliaries.\nFellowship stipends paid to Postdoctoral Scholars (expenditure type 57840) and to non-matriculated students including Visiting Researchers (expenditure type 57860) are NOT charged the GSS rate, as neither of these groups receives a Cardinal Care subsidy.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 13\nInstitutional Allowances\nSome externally-funded fellowships, such as NIH Training Grants or NSF Fellowships, provide an institutional allowance for the benefit of the fellow. This allowance is exempt from GSS. When the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) transfers this allowance to a departmental PTA, the PTA is exempt from the GSS surcharge. Expenditures subject/not subject to GSS should not be commingled in the same PTA.\nImplementing Infrastructure \nImplementing the Revised Infrastructure Charge (ISC) Policy More information about this policy can be found in the Stanford Administrative Guide 8.3.1\nAugust 31, 2005\tRev: November 8, 2010\t\nThe Board of Trustees of Stanford University approved a revised infrastructure policy in October 2004.The revised policy, effective September 1, 2005, increases the infrastructure charge from 6% to 8% for both new and existing funds. For designated funds, the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are received from all external revenue sources. For restricted funds (expendable gift funds, endowment income funds and sponsored project funds that carry an F&A rate of 0%), the infrastructure charge will be applied at the time funds are expended or transferred.\nGifts for building projects are waived from the infrastructure charges. Gifts of donated capital equipment are waived from infrastructure. However, restricted funds used to purchase capital equipment will be assessed ISC.\nThe infrastructure charge collected from non formula schools will be credited 75% to a central university PFOO (controlled by the budget office) and 25% to a central PFOO owned by the budget unit involved in the transaction. The infrastructure charge collected from formula schools and auxiliaries will be credited directly to a central PFOO belonging to the formula school or auxiliary.\nAny exceptions to the policy require approval of both the Provost and the CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all.\nThis guide provides additional detail implementing Administrative Guide Memo 3.3.1 Infrastructure Charges.\nInfrastructure Charge\nAwards are subject to the revised infrastructure policy as follows (see additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects below):\nDesignated funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on revenue in General Ledger codes 43xxx, 44xxx and 46xxx. The charge will appear on the fund statement only in General Ledger codes 48990 or 48992. \nExpendable gift and endowment income funds are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures and fund transfers including transfers to operating budgets and designated funds. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935 on the expenditure statement. The charge on fund transfers will appear in General Ledger codes 49710 or 49720 on the fund statement only. Expendable gift and endowment income funds marked \"Donor Exempt\" prior to September 1, 2005 are waived from infrastructure. All other expendable gift and endowment income funds are subject to the revised infrastructure policy.\nNon-government and foreign government sponsored project awards are assessed the infrastructure charge on expenditures. The charge on expenditures will appear in expenditure types 58915 or 58935.\nOperating budgets, budget pools, service centers, auxiliaries, miscellaneous receivables, reserves, pending funds, U.S. government sponsored projects, University Research, plant, student loans, agency and living trust funds/awards and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are waived from infrastructure by the revised policy.\nThe utility charge is discontinued.\nThe following schedules define the revised infrastructure process in detail:\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE (ISC) POLICY BY AWARD TYPE AND PURPOSE defines the categories of awards subject to the revised policy and the infrastructure charge they are assessed.\nThe schedule APPLICATION OF REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY TO FUND TRANSFERS defines the types of fund transfers that are assessed the infrastructure charge. (file updated 9/26/2008)\nThe schedule FUND TRANSFERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE defines the fund transfer General Ledger codes subject to the infrastructure charge.\nExample \u2013 Fund Transfer and Infrastructure \u2013 An example of a fund transfer from a gift to an operating budget.\nThe schedule BURDEN EXPENDITURE TYPE MAPPING SCHEDULE defines the expenditure types subject to the infrastructure charge. The new ISC charge is applied to most expenditure types.\nThe schedule INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGE EXPENDITURE TYPES/GENERAL LEDGER CODES defines the expenditure types and general ledger codes where the infrastructure assessment will appear.\nInfrastructure Exemptions and Waivers\nAny exceptions to the revised ISC Policy require approval of both the Provost and CFO and are to occur rarely, if at all. If the source of funds, typically a donor or sponsor, will not pay the infrastructure charge, the department or office may request to pay the charge themselves by applying to the Budget Office for permission to use an alternate PTA (project/task/award). Departments must use the \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form. The alternate source of funds must be able to support an expense of this nature. Designated, endowment income or expendable funds may be used. Sponsored projects may not be used. See additional guidelines concerning sponsored projects and exemptions below. If the exemption is not granted by the Provost and the Chief Financial Officer, the funds must be refused.\nAny questions about requesting a waiver to the ISC Policy should be directed to Dana Shelley in the Budget Office at ext 5-1256.\nA waiver of F&A (indirect costs) granted by the Dean of Research does not waive infrastructure.\nInfrastructure and Sponsored Projects\nThe revised Infrastructure Charge Policy applies to sponsored project awards assessed an F&A rate of 0%. Awards with F& A rates between 0% and 8% are not charged infrastructure but instead are charged their negotiated F&A rates.\nHowever, all sponsored projects awards with award start dates prior to 9/01/05 and awards made in response to previously-submitted sponsored projects proposals will continue to be subject to the prior ISC policy until the end of their competitive segment. At the time these projects are renewed, funding must be requested using the revised ISC guidelines.\nSponsored project awards are subject to the revised Infrastructure Charge Policy as follows:\nThe infrastructure charge is waived on all U.S. government - funded sponsored project awards. This includes awards directly funded by a federal, state or local governmental agency and awards that are funded on a \u201cflow-through\u201d basis using government monies.\nThe infrastructure charge is exempted (e.g., an alternate PTA is provided by the PI/department to pay the ISC charge) on all non-government sponsored project awards where the sponsor has a written policy stating that it does not pay indirect costs.\nEffective 9/1/05, if a sponsor/program is not waived or exempted under the rules listed above, the PI/administering department must include the infrastructure charge in their proposal/budget request to the sponsor. Institutional officials are responsible for reviewing proposals to make sure that the charge has been included, prior to endorsing the proposal on behalf of Stanford, or that an approved \u201cexemption\u201d (see below) is on file.\nIf a sponsor/program is not exempted as outlined above, the department may request to pay the infrastructure via an alternate PTA by submitting a \"Request for Infrastructure Exemption\" form to the Provost Office. Exemptions must be approved in advance of submission of a proposal.\nUnobligated funds remaining at the expiration of a fixed price sponsored project that are transferred to a departmental PTA on or after September 1, 1999, are not subject to the infrastructure charge provided the funds were assessed an F&A rate of 8% or greater. These funds are transferred to a departmental PTA, less the facilities and administrative costs (formerly referred to as indirect costs) that would have been assessed on additional project expenditures.\nInstitutional allowances associated with fellowships are exempt from infrastructure. Best practices recommend the institutional allowance should be spent on the sponsored award. However, the schools and departments may transfer the allowance to an existing PTA where the expenditure will not be assessed infrastructure. Please contact your OSR representative for additional guidance.\nFor questions about infrastructure charge policy, exemptions or waivers, contact Dana Shelley. For questions related to sponsored projects please contact Vrinda Gopal. For all other inquiries, please call your Fund Accounting representative or the Manager of Fund Accounting in the Controller's Office.\nSIP \nThe Stanford Infrastructure Program (SIP) consists of projects and programs proposed and developed for the betterment and general support of the University's academic community and its physical plant. The infrastructure system directly supports the academic missions of teaching and research and the overall vitality of the institution. This infrastructure will be developed as necessary to improve public safety and service and to promote conservation in land use and resources.\nFor more information on SIP go to Administrative Guide Memo 8.3.1.\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 14\nReturn to in page menu\nNow in section 15\nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY24 (Predetermined)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t54.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY23 (Predetermined)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t55.3% (MTDC)\t\nFY 22 (FINAL)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.4% (MTDC)\t\nFY 21 (FINAL)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY20\t57.7% (MTDC)\t8%* (TDC)\t57.7% (MTDC)\t\nFY19\t56.5%\t8%*\t56.5%\t\nNon-Sponsored Receivables Rates before FY19 \nFiscal Year External, higher-education users\npaying with non sponsored funds Affiliated users/Waived rate All other external users \nFY 18\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY17\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY16\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY15\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 14\t8%\t0%\t60.5%\t\nFY 13\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY12\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY11\t8%\t0%\t58% (2a)\t\nFY10\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY09\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nFY08\t8%\t0%\t58%\t\nFY07\t8%\t0%\t56.5%\t\nFY06\t8%\t0%\t56%\t\nFY05\t8%\t0%\t57%\t\nFY04\t8%\t0%\t60%\t\nNotes \n*The FY 2023 and 2024 Stanford Affiliate Rate for Stanford Affiliate external customers/users remains at 8% Total Direct Costs for service centers, cores/shared facilities in departments, schools, labs, institutes, and centers.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/receipts-gifts/resource/guidance-properly-distinguishing-gifts-sponsored-projects", "text": "Gift vs. Sponsored Projects and Distinctions from Other Forms of Funding\nDefines sponsored projects, as distinguished from gifts, student aid and other supported activities and provides guidance related to making these distinctions.\n1. Introduction\nBoth sponsored projects and gift-funded activities are externally-supported, with funds provided typically in response to a request or proposal. The classification of funding as \"gift\" or \"sponsored project\" will affect, among other things, the way Stanford University accounts for the funds, calculates and applies indirect (F&A) costs, and reports on the use of the funds to the sponsor or donor. For definitions of the various types of sponsored projects, see RPH: Categories of Sponsored Projects.\nAdministrative Staff involved in the processing of gifts, including cash, wire transfers or gifts of property, must complete Gift Administration at Stanford training.\nAdministrative Staff involved in sponsored research must complete Cardinal Curriculum Level I.\n2. Definition of Sponsored Projects\nSponsored Projects are externally-funded activities in which a formal written agreement, i.e., a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, is entered into by Stanford University and by the sponsor. A sponsored project may be thought of as a transaction in which there is a specified statement of work with a related, reciprocal transfer of something of value.\nThe following conditions characterize a sponsored project agreement, and help to distinguish such agreements from gifts.\nA. Statement of Work\nSponsored projects are typically awarded to Stanford in response to a detailed statement of work and commitment to a specified project plan. As described below, this statement of work is usually supported by both a project schedule and a line-item budget, both of which are essential to financial accountability. The statement of work and budget are usually described in a written proposal submitted by Stanford University to the sponsor for competitive review.\nB. Detailed Financial Accountability\nThe sponsored project agreement includes detailed financial accountability, typically including such conditions as:\na line-item budget related to the project plan. The terms of the agreement may specify allowable or unallowable costs, requirements for prior approvals for particular expenditures, etc.\na requirement to return any unexpended funds at the end of that period\nregular financial reporting and audit, including, for federal and state awards, accountability under the terms of OMB A-21, OMB-110 or the Uniform Guidance\nA sponsored project budget will include the University's full negotiated indirect (F&A) cost rate unless a waiver of those costs has been approved. These conditions generally define the level of financial accountability associated with a sponsored project. While not all of the above conditions are necessary to define a sponsored project, they are collectively indicative of the increased level of financial accountability associated with such projects.\nC. Disposition of Properties (\"Deliverables\")\nSponsored project agreements also usually include terms and conditions for the disposition of tangible properties (e.g., equipment, records, specified technical reports, theses, or dissertations) or intangible properties (e.g., rights in data, copyrights, and inventions). The presence of such terms and conditions in the agreement indicate that the activity is a sponsored project.\n3. Definition of Gifts\nA gift, on the other hand, is defined as any item of value given to the University by a donor who expects nothing significant of value in return, other than recognition and disposition of the gift in accordance with the donor's wishes. In general, the following characteristics describe a gift:\nA proposal/request may be submitted to the potential donor that includes a description of the proposed activities, with the understanding that the description of proposed activities is not intended as a commitment to a specific line of inquiry.\nGifts may be accompanied by an agreement that restricts the use of the funds to a particular purpose. Beyond that, no contractual requirements are imposed (beyond the requirements of responsible stewardship) and there are no \"deliverables\" to the donor, e.g., no rights to tangible or intellectual property.\nThere is no formal fiscal accountability to the donor beyond periodic progress reports and summary reports of expenditures. These reports may be thought of as requirements of stewardship, and, as such, may be required by the terms of a gift. They are not characterized as contractual obligations or \"deliverables.\"\nStanford agrees to use restricted gifts as the donor specifies, and does not accept gifts that it cannot use as the donor intends. If circumstances change such that a gift cannot be used as the donor specified, the donor must approve a change in the original restriction, or Stanford must receive court approval to waive the restriction (if the donor cannot be contacted). University approval for changes in the purpose of a gift fund can only be granted by the Provost.\n4. Definitions of Fellowships, Scholarships and Other Student Aid\nFellowships are awards of financial support to individual named students or postdoctoral scholars, or to Stanford University on behalf of individual named students or postdoctoral scholars. At Stanford, fellowships funds are normally categorized as an award of \u201cStudent Aid\u201d. However where the award of funding is made to Stanford University, where Stanford names the individuals to receive the support, and where the funds are to support research training, the funds are treated as a research training grant, a type of sponsored research project. See Attachment B. Checklist for Determining Whether Funding is a Postdoctoral Fellowship or a Sponsored Project below.\nIn order to facilitate the proper handling of fellowship support, the following procedures apply to proposal and award processes:\nA. Undergraduate or Graduate Students (External Funding)\nStudents may apply for external fellowships in their own name. The process for submitting proposals will vary, depending on whether an institutional endorsement of the application is required by the funding source.\nSubmissions requiring an institutional endorsement are submitted through the Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) or, in the School of Medicine, through the Research Management Group (RMG) Fellowship Office.\nSubmissions which do not require an institutional endorsement may be submitted directly by the student.\nWhere funds are given to Stanford University to support named undergraduate or graduate students, those funds are received and processed through the Financial Aid Office, which administers the distribution of funds. Stanford University classifies these funds as \u201cStudent Aid.\u201d\nB. Postdoctoral Scholars\nPostdoctoral Scholars who wish to apply for external fellowship funding must submit their application through either OSR or, in the School of Medicine, through RMG Fellowship Office. Awarded funds are received and processed by OSR, which administers the distribution of funds.\nPostdoctoral Fellowships are not normally defined as sponsored projects. However, because they typically provide support for the recipient\u2019s research activities, applications are processed through the research administration offices of the University. This process helps to assure appropriate internal controls as well as the inclusion of costs in the appropriate base for the calculations of Stanford\u2019s indirect (F&A) cost rates and the appropriate classification of the research space.\n5. Implementation and Administrative Issues\nA. Guidance for Properly Distinguishing Gifts from Sponsored Projects\nDistinctions Based on Source of Funds\nAny funding provided by U.S. Government agencies, at the federal, state, or local level, in support of Stanford activities is a sponsored project. Government funds are not gifts.\nDistinctions Based on Intent of Donor/Sponsor\nIn remaining cases, e.g., where funding is being provided by corporations, foundations or others not specified above, the distinction between gifts and sponsored projects will be made based on the proposal, statement of work, and terms of the agreement, taking into consideration the intent of the donor/sponsor.\nIn some situations, communication, including the proposal and award as well as conversations, makes it clear that the donor\u2019s/ sponsor\u2019s intent is to classify an award to Stanford as either a gift or a sponsored project. In these cases, the terms of the accompanying agreement may have to be adjusted in consultation with the donor/sponsor in order to clearly document the intent and avoid unintended classification.\nB. Administrative Issues\n1. Decision-Making in Unclear Situations\nIn some cases, the distinction between gift and grant, i.e., between a gift and a sponsored project, can be difficult to draw. Donors may sometimes use the word \"grant\" when the donation qualifies as a \"gift\" or vice versa. To ensure proper classification of gifts the Stanford Gift Transmittal system must be used.\nIf there are questions about the analysis or the user is unable to make a determination of gift or sponsored project, contact your Institutional Official in OSR or RMG.\nStaff members from OSR, RMG or Corporate and Foundation Relations should consult as needed with the Associate Vice Provost for Research.\n2. Donor/Sponsor Relations\nIn resolving issues related to the classification of an award, Stanford personnel must maintain an appropriate balance between the interests and preferences of the donor/sponsor and the University's administrative policies and objectives. In the process of resolving these issues it may be necessary to contact the donor/sponsor for clarification of intent and requirements, and/or to discuss the planned use of the funds.\nIf after consultation with the donor/sponsor there are still uncertainties about the donor/sponsor intent, a Conditions of Gift Letter should be used. Such contacts are usually best handled by the faculty member and/or development officer who initiated the activity.\n3. Account Set-Up\nAdministrative Guide Memo 3.1.3: Activities/Accounts, specifies the procedure and responsibilities for establishing both sponsored project and gift accounts. Whenever a new account is requested, the responsible organization (Office of Sponsored Research in the case of sponsored projects, or Fund Accounting in the case of gift funding) verifies that the account (PTA) being set up is proper, in accordance with the definitions in this policy. These offices are responsible for assuring that a proper determination of gift or grant status has been made.\n4. Indirect (Facilities & Administrative (F&A)) Cost Implications\nStanford's policy is to apply the University's full applicable indirect (F&A) cost rate to all sponsored projects. Gift funds will be assessed an infrastructure charge set by Stanford University, in accordance with the Infrastructure Charge Policy, Administrative Guide Memo 3.3.1. See in Related Items below RPH 15.2, Indirect Cost (F&A) Waivers for guidance relating to requesting waivers of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) costs are not charged on Fellowships, Scholarships or other student aid.\n6. Attachment A. Job aid for Determining Whether Funding is a Gift or Support for a Sponsored Project\nAttachment A. to this policy, the Job Aid for Determining Whether Funding is a Gift or Support for a Sponsored Project, reflects the on-line process through the Gift Transmittal System. This job aid is not intended to be used in routing a gift but only as a tool to help assist the user in the determination.\nPrint a copy of Attachment A.\nWithin the Gift Transmittal System the user will be guided through a set of questions that reflect the job aid above. The answers will assist in the determination of whether the funding is in support of a sponsored project or gift. The transaction will then be routed for further review if necessary and subsequent processing.\nIf the answers reflect the characteristics of a gift, the transaction will be routed to and processed by Gift Processing as a gift.\nIf the answers show the user is uncertain, or that the gift reflects the characteristics of a sponsored project the transmittal is routed to either OSR or in the School of Medicine RMG for further review and a final determination. If the transaction is found to be a sponsored project the user will be notified via email.\n7. Attachment B. Checklist for Determining Whether Funding is a Postdoctoral Fellowship or a Sponsored Project\nAttachment B. to this policy, Checklist for Determining Whether Funding is a Postdoctoral Fellowship or a Sponsored Project, can assist in making the determination as to whether funding should be classified as a Fellowship or Scholarship (i.e., student aid) or not.\nDownload Attachment B.\n8. Conditions of Gift Letter Templates\nThe Conditions of Gift Letter Templates are recommended for documenting simple, one-time expendable gifts from companies, professional foundations, and associations.\nThey clarify obligations and expectations such as:\nIntellectual property or data will be retained by Stanford\nStanford's infrastructure fee will be applied\nName use restrictions will apply \nDownload Attachments"}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/resource/share-value-calculation-ending-and-interim-values", "text": "Share Value Calculation (Ending and Interim Values)\nShare value (aka, Net Asset Value) is calculated by dividing the total Market Value of the Merged Pool by the Number of Shares. Stanford calculates a share value for a given month at two points in time:\nAn Ending Share Value is known for a given month following month-end close, usually mid-way into the following month. The Ending Share Value incorporates market performance, earnings and the impact of payout on share value.\nAn Interim Share Value is immediately calculated for the current month once the Ending Share Value is known for the prior month. Interim Share Value is calculated as follows:\nPrior month Ending Share Value minus current month Payout per Share\nThe Ending Share Value of the prior month is used to evaluate Payout Resources for the current month's payout (e.g., the March Ending Share Value is used to calculate Payout Resources for April). Ending Share Value is also used to determine the market value of the endowment in prior (i.e., already closed) fiscal periods. \nInterim Share Value is used for all transactions because:\nPayout is made based on shares held on the first of the month (prior to any transactions for that month).\nShares purchased with new gifts do not generate payout in the month of investment (and therefore buy into the Merged Pool using the \"after payout\" Interim Share Value).\nWithdrawn shares do generate payout in the month they are withdrawn (and so are valued at the \"after payout\" Interim Share Value).\nTransactions in/for a current month always occur after the current month Interim Share Value has been calculated.\nInterim Share Value, because it is calculated as soon as Ending Share Value is known, is the most recently calculated share value, and will represent current Market Value."}

The order will remain in your order history for 7 days as \"pending\" until the approved PO is received from the procurement platform.\nIf the approved PO is not received within 7 days from the checkout or the order falls into any of the previously mentioned exceptions, the order will be cancelled from your order history.\nHow will I know when I'll receive my order?\nAfter completing your order, you will receive a confirmation email that will state the order's \"Estimated Delivery Date\" and \"Your Shipping Speed\" (e.g., 2-Day Shipping).\nTo view and track your orders, access your Amazon Business account from iProcurement. Select Hello <Your Name> Account for Business and navigate to Your Orders. You can also customize reports of your order history in Business Analytics from the menu in the upper right corner of your home screen.\nHow can I change my \"Ship To\" address?\nOn the checkout page, Amazon Business will reference either your office address or a default Stanford University Address. Please ignore and proceed with checkout if your delivery destination is in the same state and ZIP code, since these addresses only drive the delivery speed options and not the actual delivery address. During checkout in iProcurement you will provide the accurate delivery ship-to-address prior to the approved purchase order being sent to Amazon Business. Before placing an order, you can set up your favorite deliver to locations and contacts using iProcurement Preferences.\nWhy doesn't my order receive free shipping?\nAs with Amazon.com, only Prime-eligible items (shipped and fulfilled by Amazon) are eligible for free 2-day shipping. Amazon is regularly making updates and improvements to the number of items eligible for free Prime shipping.\nCan I expedite shipping?\nItems that are eligible for expedited shipping will have the option to expedite for an additional cost during the Amazon Business Checkout process. Eligibility is dependent on availability from the seller, whether it is shipped by Amazon or by a Third-Party Seller.\nHow do scheduled deliveries carry over to iProcurement?\nScheduled deliveries can be selected on Amazon Business, but they will not carry over to iProcurement. If Amazon receives the PO within 7 days, they will consider the delivery date you selected at the time of PunchOut.

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/resource/stanford-personnel-working-abroad", "text": "Stanford Personnel Working Abroad | Global Business Services\nThere are instances where a Stanford employee may need to work abroad. As a general rule, short term \"business\" travel (under 30 days) does not present issues as long as immigration and work authorizations are addressed. However, if a program / project plans to have a significant and long-term presence in a foreign country, a range of significant issues can be triggered often resulting in increased administrative costs, regulatory compliance requirements, and potential of triggering a Presence for the individual and/or Stanford in the local jurisdiction. Legal, tax, and other considerations should be reviewed to ensure that the full impact of the presence abroad is understood and budgeted prior to the international assignment. This section focuses on some of the implications that working abroad may have on an individual, while the Stanford Status Abroad section discusses potential University implications.\nAn individual conducting Stanford activities outside of the U.S. may create a tax, employment, and possibly legal Presence for the University. University policy governing Stanford personnel working abroad can be found in Administrative Guide \u2013 Chapter 11 Global Activities. As noted in the Administrative Guide, employee requests to work in an international location for an extended period of time require the approval of the Dean, Vice Provost, or Vice President of the school / unit and the school / unit\u2019s Human Resources Manager. There must be a business purpose to support the time in country. The Stanford employee conducting the activity may be subject to tax and labor laws of the country where the activity is taking place. This includes Stanford-paid salary being subject to taxation in the foreign country.\nDepending on the nature of the activity and the amount of time spent outside of the U.S., a telecommuting agreement may be required as specified in Administrative Guide \u2013 Chapter 11.2.21, Global HR Programs and Global Business Services (GBS) must be consulted regarding employee requests to telecommute outside the country of hire prior to any decision. Work authorization and tax rules in other countries may make such arrangements very costly regardless of the level of approval.\nThe duration of time spent by an employee in a foreign country is one gauge to determine the applicability of foreign regulations. Short-term business travel under 30 days is generally straightforward. However, there are additional considerations for short-term business travel to the United Kingdom, and increasingly to other countries. Regardless of the duration of stay, individuals should ensure that entry into the country is supported by the appropriate visa (e.g., business, research, etc.).\nIf an employee expects time in another country to exceed 183 days or is repeatedly visiting the same country, consider the following:\nImmigration\nIn addition to visa requirements, extended time in country may necessitate work or residency permits. If work and residency permits are required, a Presence may be triggered.\nWork Space\nWhen working outside of the U.S. for an extended period of time, a physical Presence may be triggered by the work space and lodging that is utilized. It is almost always triggered if a lease is signed. Please note that any such contracts should be processed through Stanford\u2019s Purchasing / Contracts department.\nTax Implications\nExtended time in country could subject the employee\u2019s Stanford salary to local taxation and possibly local social tax contributions. Tax benefits arising from bilateral tax treaties between the U.S. and some countries may exempt certain types of activity. If the activity is taking place where Stanford currently has a Presence, additional guidance is available. If the time in country requires a work or residence permit or will exceed 183 days (about six months) during any 12-month period, please contact GBS for additional guidance.\nSocial Security\nIn countries where Social Security reciprocity agreements (totalization agreements) are available, U.S. Social Security and Medicare taxes continue to apply to wages for up to five years. Proof of exemption from paying Social Security in the country of assignment must be provided to the appropriate foreign authorities by means of a certificate of coverage (which certifies continuing coverage in the U.S.). More information on international Social Security agreements abroad is available through the U.S. Social Security Administration.\nHuman Resources / Personnel / Employment\nStanford personnel working abroad are subject to the existing University personnel policies described in Stanford Administrative Guide \u2013 Chapter 11 Global Activities. However, it is important to notify Global HR in advance of such assignments to ensure that the employee and the University plan adequately for the local compliance requirements for the foreign location. This may involve consultation with outside experts.\nBenefits / Health Insurance Coverage\nStanford personnel traveling abroad on official University business for short-term or extended business purposes should review their individual medical and insurance coverages, and inform themselves about the University's business travel accident and emergency medical and evacuation coverages through the Crisis24 website. Learn about your health benefits when traveling outside the U.S and emergency medical and evacuation benefits.\nGoverning Policies\nStanford personnel working abroad remain subject to the existing University policies, including the policies described in the University's Administrative Guide, the Stanford Bulletin, the Faculty Handbook, and the Research Policy Handbook.\nWhat's Next?\nSubmit a Support Request to GBS with your project title, department name, travel dates, and type of activity if the following apply:\nIf you will be working where Stanford has a Presence; or\nIf you will spend more than six months, or 183 days, in any country or if your stay requires a work or residency permit."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/resource/faculty-handbook-32-sabbatical-leave", "text": "Chapter 3: Sabbaticals and Other Leaves of Absence Applicable to the Academic Council and University Medical Professoriates\nHandbook last updated: January 17, 2024\nJump To:\n3.1 General Policies Applicable to Leaves and Other Absences From Campus\n3.2 Sabbatical Leave\n3.3 Leave Without Salary\n3.4 Period of Pure Research Leave\n3.5 Family and Medical Leave Policy\n3.1 General Policies Applicable to Leaves and Other Absences From Campus\n3.1.1 Limitations on Leaves\nIt is University policy to place limitations on the granting of leaves. When considering a faculty member\u2019s leave request, the department Chair and school Dean should determine whether the following four limitations have been satisfied:\nOverall limit on leave. The total time spent on leaves of any kind normally should not exceed six quarters in seven years for faculty with 9 month appointments or 24 months in seven years for faculty with 12 month appointments. (To determine this limit, count back seven years from the end date of a proposed leave. In this calculation, partial leaves will be prorated dependent on departmental policies and practices.)\nLimit on contiguous absence. In addition, leaves of any kind, or combinations of leaves, may not exceed 24 contiguous months for faculty with 12 month appointments or two consecutive academic years for faculty with 9 month appointments, irrespective of percent time off duty.\nLimit on Partial leave. Leaves are normally at 100% FTE. If the faculty member has requested to remain on-duty for any percent FTE to continue with responsibilities other than research (i.e. administrative, teaching or other duties), the exception policy described under \"Additional Considerations\" below applies.\nRetirement. A faculty member must serve at Stanford for a period of time at least equal to the length of their most recent leave prior to retirement.\nAdditional Considerations. Exceptions to these limitations may be approved by the Provost, at the Provost\u2019s discretion, in rare circumstances such as when positive advantages to the University outweigh the possible adverse effects on University programs, or when the following types of leave are involved: pregnancy disability or other disability leave, childcare leave, family and medical leave, workers compensation leave, or leave for government service at a high level. Faculty with questions about this policy should contact their Dean's Office.\nWhen a department has requests for an unusual number of leaves at any one time, pregnancy disability or other disability leaves, childcare leaves, family and medical leaves, worker\u2019s compensation leaves, and sabbatical leaves have priority. It is appropriate for department Chairs and Deans to refuse or delay certain requests for sabbatical leave and for leave without salary when resulting absences would make it difficult for the department to meet its instructional and research obligations.\nEven when on leave, faculty members are expected to adhere to the general obligation of faculty to be responsive to communications from their departments, schools and the university. Stanford University uses electronic means (such as email, texts, and the Internet) as a method of communication to faculty. For many University communications, email to a faculty member\u2019s email account is the official form of notification to the faculty member, and emails sent by University officials to such email addresses will be presumed to have been received and read by the faculty member.\n3.1.2 Short Absences\nFaculty members do not accrue vacation leave or sick leave. However, short absences for personal business, illness, jury duty, and similarly limited absences normally are with full salary. It is expected that when scheduling periods of leave with pay, one's academic responsibilities are taken into consideration and continue to be fulfilled. The department Chair should be notified in advance of any absence of a faculty member on active duty that may affect class, laboratory, research, or other University commitments, including graduate student supervision.\n3.1.3 Military Leaves\nPlease refer to Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.18 for procedures regarding faculty members who are required to fulfill active military training and/or active military duty.\n3.1.4 Supplemental School Policies and Practices\nAs noted above, the granting or denying of leaves or extended absences from campus are generally at the discretion of the department Chairs and school Deans. Schools have different policies and practices with regard to sabbatical leaves and other leaves of absence. To the extent that these may be at variance with University-wide policy, advance approval must be obtained from the Provost by the department Chair and the school Dean. Exceptions to the University\u2019s leave policies may be approved by the Provost, at the Provost's discretion. Questions regarding leaves should be referred to the school Dean\u2019s Offices.\n3.2 Sabbatical Leave\n3.2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of the sabbatical leave program is to free faculty members from their normal University duties, enabling them to pursue their scholarly interests full-time and maintain their professional standing so that they may return to their posts with renewed vigor, perspective, and insight.\nThose eligible to take sabbatical leave are: Assistant Professors, Associate Professors, and Professors in the Tenure Line; Non-Tenure Line Assistant Professors, Associate Professors and Professors; Center and Senior Fellows at designated policy centers or institutes; and Assistant Professors, Associate Professors, and Professors in the University Medical Line.\nFaculty on sabbatical leave remain subject to the policies on conflict of commitment and interest and outside consulting activities, which may be found at https://doresearch.stanford.edu/policies/research-policy-handbook/conflicts-commitment-and-interest\n3.2.2 Sabbatical Leave Request\nSabbatical leave is not automatic. It is granted by the school Dean following approval of a leave request proposal by the department Chair(s). In the case of joint/secondary appointments, faculty must take sabbatical leave from all (primary, joint, secondary) departments, schools and designated policy centers or institutes. Sabbatical leaves must be approved by all departments, schools and designated policy centers or institutes. The leave request form is provided in Appendix A.\nThe application for leave includes a description of arrangements to cover the faculty member\u2019s instructional responsibilities, supervision of their dissertation students and advisees, and other administrative duties for which the faculty member is responsible. In addition, the application must fully describe activity planned for the leave period. If the individual expects to receive income during the sabbatical period to supplement their sabbatical salary, a description of the activities generating such income, and the anticipated amounts, should be included (except for consulting activities performed in accordance with Stanford\u2019s consulting policy). Substantial changes in leave plans or supplemental income require approval by the department Chair and Dean.\nThe University compensation associated with a sabbatical leave is intended to make it financially possible for a faculty member to carry out their leave program. Projected outside earnings may be taken into account in the decision to grant sabbatical leave and in setting the percentage of salary to be received from the University. Total compensation during a sabbatical leave should not normally exceed the faculty member\u2019s full-time Stanford base salary for the leave period.\nFaculty on sabbatical continue to be eligible for health and welfare benefits coverage and receive the full University contribution for such coverage.\n3.2.3 Appointments at Other Institutions\nA faculty member on sabbatical leave may not take a regular faculty or administrative position at another institution of higher education. However, faculty on sabbatical leave may accept a visiting professor appointment at another educational institution.\n3.2.4 Service Accrual Toward Sabbatical Leave\nTo be counted toward sabbatical leave, full-time service must include a reasonable amount of teaching (which may take a variety of forms) each year at Stanford. (Exceptions to this rule are the faculty at SLAC, members of the Non-Tenure Line (Research) professoriate, Senior Fellows and Center Fellows.) Participation in a Stanford overseas program or in field work that is an integral part of a department\u2019s academic program is considered regular service at Stanford and accrues eligibility toward sabbatical leave. Time spent on leave without salary, extended absences for reason such as illness, periods of pure research (as defined in Section 2.1.4.2.c), and full-time non-teaching service are normally excluded in calculating sabbatical eligibility.\nFaculty on a quarterly calendar may accrue sabbatical eligibility during a maximum of 3 quarters in 1 year. A fourth quarter of teaching or sponsored research does not add sabbatical eligibility.\nFaculty on a 12 month calendar may accrue sabbatical eligibility during a maximum of 12 months per year.\nSabbatical leave may be accrued on a pro rata basis by regular part-time service at 50% time or more, under the same conditions of eligibility as applied to full-time service.\nService as Assistant Professor (Subject to Ph.D.) may be accrued toward sabbatical leave if the individual is subsequently appointed to an eligible rank, provided that the appointments are contiguous.\nEffective 1/1/96, the maximum service toward sabbatical that a faculty member may accrue is 36 quarters (24 semesters, 12 years). A sabbatical cap of less than 36 will apply on a pro rata basis if the individual's appointment is less than 100% time.\nIt is not necessary to obtain Provostial approval for accrual of any amount up to the maximum. Accrual beyond this maximum is normally not permitted.\n3.2.5 Calculating Sabbatical Leave Duration and Rate of Pay\nThe usual minimum length of sabbatical is one quarter or semester at 50% salary, or 2 months at 100% salary. The maximum length of sabbatical leave is one year, without regard to rate of pay. See Tables 1-3 at the end of this chapter to determine leave eligibility and rate of pay during leave if the faculty member is conducting sponsored research during their leave. This table is also to be used if a faculty member does not have enough sabbatical credits; they may still be relieved of duties at 100% FTE, but the portion of their leave that they do not have sabbatical credits for will be unpaid.\nDETERMINING LEAVE ELIGIBILITY AND PAY - QUARTER CALENDAR - TABLE 1\n(Sabbatical leave during the fourth quarter is not available to faculty holding a 9-month appointments)\nService Quarters\n(excluding Summer)Length of Sabbatical\n(in Quarters)Rate of Pay\nDuring Leave\n6\t1\t50.00%\t\n7\t1\t58.33%\t\n8\t1\t66.67%\t\n9\t1\t75.00%\t\n10\t1\t83.33%\t\n11\t1\t91.67%\t\n12\t1\t100.00%\t\n12\t2\t50.00%\t\n13\t2\t54.17%\t\n14\t2\t58.33%\t\n15\t2\t62.50%\t\n16\t2\t66.67%\t\n17\t2\t70.83%\t\n18\t2\t75.00%\t\n18\t3\t50.00%\t\n19\t2\t79.17%\t\n19\t3\t52.78%\t\n20\t2\t83.33%\t\n20\t3\t55.56%\t\n21\t2\t87.50%\t\n21\t3\t58.33%\t\n22\t2\t91.67%\t\n22\t3\t61.11%\t\n23\t2\t95.83%\t\n23\t3\t63.89%\t\n24\t2\t100.00%\t\n24\t3\t66.67%\t\n25\t3\t69.44%\t\n26\t3\t72.22%\t\n27\t3\t75.00%\t\n28\t3\t77.78%\t\n29\t3\t80.56%\t\n30\t3\t83.33%\t\n31\t3\t86.11%\t\n32\t3\t88.89%\t\n33\t3\t91.67%\t\n34\t3\t94.44%\t\n35\t3\t97.22%\t\n36\t3\t100.00%\t\nDETERMINING LEAVE ELIGIBILITY AND PAY - 12 MONTH CALENDAR - TABLE 2\nService YearsService MonthsLength of Sabbatical\n(in Months)Rate of Pay\nDuring Leave\n2\t(24)\t2\t100.00%\t\n2\t(24)\t3\t66.67%\t\n2\t(24)\t4\t50.00%\t\n3\t(36)\t3\t100.00%\t\n3\t(36)\t4\t75.00%\t\n3\t(36)\t5\t60.00%\t\n3\t(36)\t6\t50.00%\t\n4\t(48)\t4\t100.00%\t\n4\t(48)\t5\t80.00%\t\n4\t(48)\t6\t66.67%\t\n4\t(48)\t7\t57.14%\t\n4\t(48)\t8\t50.00%\t\n5\t(60)\t5\t100.00%\t\n5\t(60)\t6\t83.33%\t\n5\t(60)\t7\t71.43%\t\n5\t(60)\t8\t62.50%\t\n5\t(60)\t9\t55.56%\t\n5\t(60)\t10\t50.00%\t\n6\t(72)\t6\t100.00%\t\n6\t(72)\t7\t85.71%\t\n6\t(72)\t8\t75.00%\t\n6\t(72)\t9\t66.67%\t\n6\t(72)\t10\t60.00%\t\n6\t(72)\t11\t54.55%\t\n6\t(72)\t12\t50.00%\t\n7\t(84)\t7\t100.00%\t\n7\t(84)\t8\t87.50%\t\n7\t(84)\t9\t77.78%\t\n7\t(84)\t10\t70.00%\t\n7\t(84)\t11\t63.64%\t\n7\t(84)\t12\t58.33%\t\n8\t(96)\t8\t100.00%\t\n8\t(96)\t9\t88.89%\t\n8\t(96)\t10\t80.00%\t\n8\t(96)\t11\t72.73%\t\n8\t(96)\t12\t66.67%\t\n9\t(108)\t9\t100.00%\t\n9\t(108)\t10\t90.00%\t\n9\t(108)\t11\t81.82%\t\n9\t(108)\t12\t75.00%\t\n10\t(120)\t10\t100.00%\t\n10\t(120)\t11\t90.91%\t\n10\t(120)\t12\t83.33%\t\n11\t(132)\t11\t100.00%\t\n11\t(132)\t12\t91.67%\t\n12\t(144)\t12\t100.00% \t\n3.2.6 Return to Service Following Sabbatical Leave\nA faculty member must serve at Stanford for a period of time at least equal to the length of their most recent sabbatical prior to taking another sabbatical leave or terminating employment with the University. Sabbatical leave may not be taken during a one-year terminal extension of a regular term appointment; upon recommendation from the Dean of the faculty member\u2019s school, the Provost may approve an exception to this policy under special circumstances. The purpose of the sabbatical leave program is to enable faculty to pursue their scholarly interests full-time and then return to their posts. Accordingly, accrued sabbatical time expires upon termination of employment with the University; there is no compensation given at that time for unused sabbatical.\n3.2.7 Borrowing Sabbatical Leave Eligibility\nThe University recognizes the need to provide opportunities for junior faculty to develop their research and scholarship. To assist them during a critical period of their careers, non-tenured Assistant and non-tenured Associate Professors may, upon reappointment for a multiple-year term and with the approval of their department Chair and Dean, borrow up to three years of service credit to be eligible for a sabbatical leave of longer duration or a higher rate of pay (up to the sabbatical policy maximum). A faculty member will not normally be permitted to borrow service beyond the end date of the term of appointment.\nTenured faculty and faculty with continuing term appointments may not normally borrow sabbatical leave service credit.\n3.3 Leave Without Salary\nA leave without salary is any period of leave that is completely without salary paid by or through Stanford University or its disability benefits program.\n3.3.1 Requesting a Leave Without Salary\nLeaves of absence without salary should be requested on the standard leave request form (Appendix A) for review and approval by the department Chair and Dean of the school.\n3.3.2 Reviewing a Request for Leave Without Salary\nIn making the decision to approve or deny a leave without salary request, consideration will be given to the faculty member\u2019s teaching and other contributions to the educational program of the University, scholarly productivity, number of Ph.D.\u2019s completed under their supervision, previous leaves without salary, and any other relevant circumstances.\n3.3.3 Appointments at Other Institutions\nA faculty member on leave without salary may not take a regular faculty or administrative position at another institution of higher education. However, faculty on leave without salary may accept a visiting professor appointment at another educational institution.\n3.3.4 Effect on an Appointment for a Term of Years\nA leave without salary extends a term appointment held by a member of the Professoriate, irrespective of faculty line, by a period equal to the duration of the leave, unless there is advanced written agreement to the contrary. This extension is not automatic; it must be accomplished through normal processes, with the submission of a online FASA (Faculty and Academic Staff Application) transaction by the department or school, when the faculty member has concluded their leave without salary. For additional information about the effect of a leave without salary on a faculty member\u2019s appointment, see the \u201cExtending the Appointment\u201d sections for each professorial line in Chapter 2 of this handbook.\n3.3.5 Effect on the Tenure Clock and Appointment Clock Deadlines\nA leave without salary taken by an untenured Tenure Line faculty member also extends their seven year tenure clock. It does not extend the ten year appointment clock deadline. For additional information, see 2.1.4.2 of this handbook.\n3.3.6 Period of Partial Unpaid Leave\nPeriods of partial leave without salary have the same effect as described above, but on a proportional basis.\n3.4 Period of Pure Research Leave\nFaculty members, other than Assistant Professors (Research), Associate Professors (Research), Professors (Research), and Center and Senior Fellows in designated policy centers or institutes, may apply for a period of pure research, which is defined as leave from teaching and other institutional responsibilities during which the faculty member receives full or partial salary through Stanford from sponsored research.\n3.4.1 Requesting a Period of Pure Research Leave\nApplications for periods of pure research should be requested on the regular leave form (Appendix A) for review and approval by the department Chair and Dean of the school.\n3.4.2 Reviewing a Request for Period of Pure Research Leave\nIn making the decision to approve or deny a period of pure research leave request, consideration will be given to the faculty member\u2019s teaching and other contributions to the educational program of the University, scholarly productivity, number of Ph.D.\u2019s completed under their supervision, previous leaves without salary, and any other relevant circumstances.\n3.4.3 Effect on Sabbatical Leave Service Accrual\nSabbatical eligibility does not accrue during periods of pure research.\n3.4.4 Effect on the Tenure Clock and Appointment Clock Deadlines\nA period of Pure Research Leave does not extend the seven year tenure clock or the ten year appointment clock deadline. For additional information, see 2.1.4.2.c and 2.1.4.2.d of this handbook.\n3.5 Family and Medical Leave Policy\nThe following sections describe categories of leave that may be available to faculty who wish to reduce their responsibilities or take a leave of absence to meet family or personal obligations or needs. It should be noted that the leaves and other arrangements described in this document may extend the tenure clock and/or the length of a term appointment (see section 2.1.4.2.b of this handbook). It should also be noted that temporary instructors are frequently needed when faculty take family-related or medical leaves. When this is the case, department Chairs and school Deans are responsible for making the necessary appointment arrangements. If a faculty member does not apply for available disability benefits or for disability benefits, the School will not pay the equivalent of the disability benefit available under the University\u2019s disability benefit programs.\n3.5.1 Pregnancy Disability Leave\nCalifornia\u2019s Pregnancy Disability Leave Law (PDL) allows for leave of up to four months of disability leave due to medically certified, pregnancy-related disability. During pregnancy disability leave, the faculty member is expected to apply for disability insurance according to established procedures. (Specific instructions are available at http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu.) The length of pregnancy disability leave is determined by the faculty member\u2019s physician, who certifies the number of weeks that the faculty member is disabled, both before and after delivery. The University will pay the faculty member the difference between the disability benefit and full academic base salary while on disability due to pregnancy. Department Chairs and Deans are expected to routinely approve requests for pregnancy disability leave. Sabbatical leaves are intended for professional development and should not be used for pregnancy-related leave. In addition, the faculty member is encouraged to contact their department Chair or Dean\u2019s Office to address issues pertaining to teaching, research, appointment dates, tenure clock deadline, grant administration and other related issues.\n3.5.2 Family and Medical Leave\nStanford\u2019s policy on Family and Medical Leave (FML) for Faculty follows the guidelines of the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) of 1991 (amended in 1993, 2020, 2022) and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. This legislation provides for up to 12 weeks of job protected unpaid leave in any 12 month period for eligible employees for certain family and medical reasons. Family or medical leave may be taken for the following reasons:\nUnder FMLA, to care for the faculty member\u2019s spouse, same sex domestic partner, parent, or child who has a serious health condition that requires the faculty member\u2019s absence from work to care for the ill family member. [In this case, the faculty member may also be eligible for Paid Family Leave];\nUnder CFRA, to care for the faculty member\u2019s spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, parent-in-law (parent of spouse or domestic partner), grandparent, grandchild, or sibling who has a serious health condition that requires the faculty member\u2019s absence from work to care for the ill family member. [In this case, the faculty member may also be eligible for Paid Family Leave];\nFor a faculty member\u2019s serious health condition [In this case, the faculty member may also be eligible for short term or long term disability];\nFor bonding as described below in section 3.5.3 [In this case, the faculty member may also be eligible for Paid Family Leave];\nTo care for a family member who is a member of the Armed Services and suffers serious injury in the line of duty or is undergoing treatment or recuperation from a serious injury (up to 26 weeks). The Faculty member must be a spouse, parent, son, daughter, or next of kin of the service member. [In this case, the faculty member may also be eligible for Paid Family Leave];\nProtected qualifying exigency leave for the spouse, domestic partner, child or parent (include parent-in-law under CFRA) of the service member in the Armed Forces.\nA serious health condition is defined as any illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition serious enough to involve hospitalization, in-patient care in a residential medical facility, or continuing treatment or supervision by a health care provider. In the case of a serious personal health condition, the faculty member may be eligible for short-term or long-term disability payments.\nTo be eligible for family or medical leave, an individual must have been employed by Stanford (within the U.S.) for at least 12 months and work 1250 hours in the 12 months prior to the leave start date. An individual is not eligible if they have already used the maximum yearly leave entitlement provided by law. Under University policy, if the faculty member is eligible for FML and the leave is for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition, the University will pay the faculty member the difference between their disability benefit and the faculty member\u2019s full academic base salary.\nWhen the need for family leave is foreseeable, requests for family or medical leave should be made sufficiently in advance to allow the school or department to make replacement teaching and other arrangements. In some circumstances, faculty may take their family or medical leave intermittently or on a reduced schedule basis. (Specific information is available at http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu.) During family or medical leave, the University continues its contributions toward medical and dental group health plans. The faculty member continues to be responsible for paying their own premium. If additional leave is approved beyond the 12 weeks of family or medical leave, the faculty member must pay the University\u2019s portion of the monthly premium in addition to their own premium to ensure continuous insurance coverage.\n3.5.3 Paid Family Leave\nPaid Family Leave (PFL) insurance is available to all faculty members who participate in the Stanford Voluntary Disability Insurance (VDI) Plan or the California State Disability Insurance (SDI) Plan. It provides partial wage replacement during an approved Family and Medical Leave to care for a seriously ill family member or bonding with a new child. The relationship between PFL and FML and/or CFRA is that FML and/or CFRA provides eligible employees up to 12 work weeks of unpaid job protected leave in a 12-month period for their own serious health condition, to care for a family member with a serious health condition, or because of the birth or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. PFL does not change or extend FML and/or CFRA in any way and is completely separate from it. PFL merely provides up to eight weeks of paid insurance benefits to employees who suffer a wage loss when they take time off work to care for a family member covered by the PFL regulations. If a faculty member is eligible for FML and/or CFRA, they are required to take FML and/or CFRA at the same time they are receiving PFL. The University will pay the faculty member the difference between their PFL benefit and their full academic base salary while they are on PFL.\nPlease note baby bonding leaves under FML and CFRA concurrently run for a total of 12 weeks; however, for maternity bonding leaves, PDL (pregnancy disability leave) and FML also run concurrently, but the female faculty member is then eligible to receive an additional 12 weeks of bonding leave under CFRA. CFRA runs concurrently with PFL (paid family leave). Additional information is available at http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu.\n3.5.4 Short-Term and Long-Term Disability Leave\nWhere the leave is for a faculty member\u2019s own health condition, the University will pay the faculty member the difference between their short-term disability benefit (up to a maximum amount established each January 1st) and/or their long-term disability benefit (66 2/3%) and their full academic base salary for up to 52 weeks, or the end date of their faculty appointment, whichever comes first, provided they continue to be medically certified by a physician and otherwise meet the terms of the disability plan. The 52-week period starts from the initial certification date as designated by the University\u2019s current provider of disability and/or workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If a faculty member is overpaid in this salary supplement process, the faculty member must reimburse the University for the overpayment either by direct payment or through payroll deduction. Faculty members experiencing a short-term, non-work related disability (including pregnancy disability) or long-term disability (LTD) are expected to contact Benefits (http://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu) to obtain information about and to apply for the University\u2019s disability benefits. In addition, the faculty member is expected to contact their department Chair or Dean\u2019s Office to address issues pertaining to teaching, research, appointment dates, tenure clock deadline, grant administration and other related issues. For more information on LTD, see the Long Term Disability FAQs for Faculty. If your physician has certified you for full-time disability leave, you cannot perform work in any capacity.\n3.5.5 Reduced Teaching and Clinical Duties Policy for New Parents\nThis University policy is intended to provide faculty who become new parents with additional flexibility in their work schedule at the time of the birth or adoption of the child. To that end, a faculty member who gives birth may request a reduced teaching load during the quarter of the birth and/or in the subsequent quarter, if these are quarters in which the faculty member is normally expected to teach. Similarly, faculty who become parents or adopt a child no older than five years of age may request a reduced teaching load during the quarter of the arrival of the child or in the subsequent quarter, if these are quarters in which they are expected to teach. During these quarters, the expectation is that the faculty member will remain on full salary and, except during pregnancy disability leave (if applicable), that they will continue to carry a full complement of professorial activities other than classroom teaching, such as research and scholarship, graduate and undergraduate student advising, committee work, etc. If the faculty member wishes to return to classroom teaching sooner, they may do so, but this should be a free choice on the faculty member\u2019s part.\nFor most faculty in clinical departments in the School of Medicine, the closest analogy to classroom teaching with respect to time and effort is clinical service. A faculty member who gives birth may request to be excused from clinical responsibilities (as well as classroom teaching, if any) for 90 days following the end of the pregnancy disability leave. (During pregnancy disability leave, the faculty member is not on duty at all; as noted above, the period of pregnancy disability leave may be up to four months.) New parents may request to be excused from clinical duties (as well as classroom teaching, if any) for 90 days immediately following the arrival of the child. During these 90 days, the expectation is that the faculty member will remain on full salary and that they will continue to carry a full complement of professorial activities, other than clinical duties (and classroom teaching, if any), such as research and scholarship, advising, committee work, etc. If the faculty member wishes to return to clinical responsibilities (or classroom teaching, if any) sooner, they may do so, but this should be a free choice on their part. If advanced planning efforts of the faculty member and department indicate the need temporarily to hire a physician to provide clinical coverage, funds for this purpose will be provided by the Practice Plan. A justification of request for such funds will be required.\nEligibility under this policy is different from (and more limited than) eligibility under the policies for new parent tenure clock and appointment extensions. This reduced teaching and clinical duties policy is not intended for parents whose newborn or newly adopted child is cared for more than half-time by either a spouse/partner or a childcare provider. A faculty member using this policy would normally be the sole caregiver for at least twenty hours during the work week during the hours from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. To apply for this policy, faculty should complete the form entitled \u201cApplication for Reduced Teaching or Clinical Duties for New Faculty Parents.\u201d\nIn implementing this policy, the faculty member should not be expected to assume a heavier than normal teaching load when returning to regular teaching duty. Department Chairs and Deans should guard against any possible adverse consequences to faculty members on account of using this policy. For instance, while it is proper for department Chairs and Deans to take into consideration an individual\u2019s productivity and contribution to the department or school during the prior year when setting salaries, the same standards should apply to all faculty in the unit without respect to the type of leave taken. The reduction of teaching and clinical duties under this policy does not extend the seven year tenure clock or the ten year appointment clock.\n3.5.6 Childcare Leave Policy\nAny faculty member, male or female, who becomes a parent whether by birth or adoption, may request a leave without salary of up to one year, at full or part-time, for the purpose of caring for the child. For a faculty member who gives birth, such a leave could be in addition to pregnancy disability leave; for all parents such leave should be in addition to a period of reduced teaching and clinical duties. Requests for childcare leave are subject to the normal approval process, but department Chairs and Deans are urged to give priority to such requests. Once again, faculty members may not use accrued sabbatical leave for childcare leave.\nA faculty member on full leave without salary must pay the University\u2019s portion of the monthly benefits premium in addition to their own premium to insure continuous insurance coverage. For faculty members on partial leave, the University\u2019s contribution may continue, depending on the percent time of the leave. Those on leave less than 50% time are responsible for the entire cost of insurance premiums. Those on leave at 25% to 50% of full time receive a partial University contribution, and those on leave less than 25% time receive the full usual University contribution."}

This Addendum sets forth the terms and conditions under which any PHI will be handled by Business Associate.\nThe Parties agree as follows:\n1. Definitions\nAll capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Addendum have the meaning set forth in HITECH/HIPAA and regulations issued thereunder, and state privacy laws, including but not limited to the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (\u201cCMIA\u201d) and breach notification laws (e.g., California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 1280.15 and Civil Code \u00a7 1798.82 et seq., as these may be amended from time to time). Any discrepancies between definitions will be resolved to comply with the HIPAA Rules.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term \u201cBreach\u201d as used herein also means unlawful or unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of PHI pursuant to state laws.\n2.

In the event that the PHI received by Business Associate pursuant to the Agreement constitutes a Designated Record Set, Business Associate will, at the request of Stanford, (i) provide Stanford with access to the PHI to enable Stanford to fulfill its obligations under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.524, or (ii) make any amendment(s) to the PHI that Stanford directs pursuant to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.526.\n3.10: Individual Requests.

As provided under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.504(e)(2)(iii), Stanford may immediately terminate this Addendum and the Agreement if Stanford knows of a pattern of activity or practice of Business Associate that constitutes a material breach or violation of Business Associate\u2019s obligations under the provisions of this Addendum.\n4.3: Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the Agreement and this Addendum pursuant to Section 4.2, Business Associate shall return to Stanford, or if agreed by Stanford, destroy all PHI received from Stanford, or created, maintained, or received by Business Associate on behalf of Stanford, that Business Associate and its agents and Subcontractors still maintain in any form. If such return or destruction is not feasible, then Business Associate will so notify Stanford in writing, and shall (a) extend any and all protections, obligations, limitations and restrictions contained in this Addendum to PHI retained by Business Associate, its agents and its Subcontractors after the termination of the Agreement and this Addendum, (b) limit any further uses and/or disclosures to those purposes that make the return or destruction of the PHI infeasible and (c) at such time as return or destruction of such retained PHI becomes feasible, return or, if agreed by Stanford, destroy such PHI.\n5. Miscellaneous\n5.1: Interpretation; Inconsistences between Agreement and Addendum. The provisions of this Addendum prevail over any provisions in the Agreement that may conflict or appear inconsistent with any provisions in this Addendum. Any ambiguity in this Addendum will be resolved in favor of a meaning that complies and is consistent with the Privacy Regulation and Security Regulation.\n5.2: State Law. Nothing in this Addendum is to be construed to require or permit Business Associate to use or disclose PHI without proper written authorization, where such authorization would be required under state law for such use or disclosure.\n5.3: Injunctions. In addition to any other remedies available to Stanford at law, in equity, or under this Addendum, in the event of any violation of any of the provisions of this Addendum, or any explicit threat thereof, Stanford will be entitled to an injunction or other decree of specific performance with respect to such violation(s) or explicit threat thereof."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/resource/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee", "text": "Independent contractor (self-employed) or employee?\nIt is critical that business owners correctly determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or independent contractors.\nGenerally, you must withhold and deposit income taxes, social security taxes and Medicare taxes from the wages paid to an employee. Additionally, you must also pay the matching employer portion of social security and Medicare taxes as well as pay unemployment tax on wages paid to an employee. Generally, you do not have to withhold or pay any taxes on payments to independent contractors.\nSelect the scenario that applies to you:\nI am an independent contractor or in business for myself. If you are a business owner or contractor who provides services to other businesses, then you are generally considered self-employed. For more information on your tax obligations if you are self-employed (an independent contractor), see our self-employed individuals tax center.\nI hire or contract with individuals to provide services to my business. If you are a business owner hiring or contracting with other individuals to provide services, then you must determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or independent contractors. Follow the rest of this page to find out more about this topic and what your responsibilities are.\nDetermining whether the individuals providing services are employees or independent contractors\nBefore you can determine how to treat payments you make for services, you must first know the business relationship that exists between you and the person performing the services. The person performing the services may be:\nAn employee (common-law employee)\nA government worker\nIn determining whether the person providing service is an employee or an independent contractor, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and independence must be considered.\nCommon law rules\nFacts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories:\nBehavioral: Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?\nFinancial: Are the business aspects of the worker\u2019s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)\nType of relationship: Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (that is, pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship continue and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?\nBusinesses must weigh all these factors when determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor. Some factors may indicate that the worker is an employee, while other factors indicate that the worker is an independent contractor. There is no \u201cmagic\u201d or set number of factors that \u201cmakes\u201d the worker an employee or an independent contractor and no one factor stands alone in making this determination. Also, factors which are relevant in one situation may not be relevant in another.\nThe keys are to look at the entire relationship and consider the extent of the right to direct and control the worker. Finally, document each of the factors used in coming up with the determination.\nRemote worker\nAn individual working remotely, for example, performing services for you from a location other than an office operated by you, is your employee under the common-law rules, if you can control what will be done and how it will be done. This is so even if the worker can choose to work remotely. What matters is that you have the right to control the details of how the services are performed.\nIf the remote worker is a U.S. citizen or resident alien employed outside the United States by an American employer review the following pages for additional information.\nFederal income tax withholding for persons employed abroad by a U.S. person\nSocial Security and Medicare tax for U.S. citizens and resident aliens employed abroad by American employer\nU.S. citizens and resident aliens employed abroad - FUTA\nForm SS-8\nIf it is still unclear whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor after reviewing the three categories of evidence, then Form SS-8, Determination of Worker Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding PDF, can be filed with the IRS. The form may be filed by either the business or the worker. The IRS will review the facts and circumstances and officially determine the worker\u2019s status.\nBe aware that it can take at least six months to get a determination. A business that continually hires the same types of workers to perform particular services may want to consider filing the Form SS-8 PDF.\nEmployment tax obligations\nOnce a determination is made (whether by the business or by the IRS), the next step is filing the appropriate forms and paying the associated taxes.\nMisclassification of employees\nConsequences of treating an employee as an independent contractor\nIf you classify an employee as an independent contractor and you have no reasonable basis for doing so, then you may be held liable for employment taxes for that worker (the relief provisions, discussed below, will not apply). See Internal Revenue Code section 3509 for more information.\nRelief provisions\nIf you have a reasonable basis for not treating a worker as an employee, then you may be relieved from having to pay employment taxes for that worker. To get this relief, you must file all required federal information returns on a basis consistent with your treatment of the worker. You (or your predecessor) must not have treated any worker holding a substantially similar position as an employee for any periods beginning after 1977. See Publication 1976, Section 530 Employment Tax Relief Requirements PDF, for more information.\nMisclassified workers can file Social Security tax form\nWorkers who believe they have been improperly classified as independent contractors by an employer can use Form 8919, Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages, to figure and report the employee\u2019s share of uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes due on their compensation.\nVoluntary Classification Settlement Program\nThe Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP) is an optional program that provides taxpayers with an opportunity to reclassify their workers as employees for future tax periods for employment tax purposes with partial relief from federal employment taxes for eligible taxpayers that agree to prospectively treat their workers (or a class or group of workers) as employees. To participate in this voluntary program, the taxpayer must meet certain eligibility requirements. Apply to participate in the VCSP by filing Form 8952, Application for Voluntary Classification Settlement Program, in order to enter into a closing agreement with the IRS."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/resource/common-sales-tax-exempt-categories", "text": "Common Sales Tax Exempt Categories\nThe following categories of purchased goods or services are generally exempt from sales tax. Select a category for description and examples:\nQualified federally sponsored purchases by Stanford where the Federal government takes title at the time of purchase. This also applies to subcontracts with non government entities where the prime contract/grant is federally funded. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 17).\nThe sale of services (including consulting) where no tangible personal property is transferred, or where the transfer of property is incidental, is non-taxable.\nLabor charges for the installation or application of a product are non-taxable. Labor charges to repair a product to perform its original function are non-taxable. However, improving or changing a product's function constitutes fabrication which is taxable. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 6).\nProperty purchased for resale by Stanford, or property purchased that will become a part of such property, is exempt. A resale certificate should be issued to the vendor. However, sales tax must be collected on the price of the property when it is sold. If the property is used before it is resold, the purchaser becomes liable for use tax. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 13).\nSeparately stated charges for transportation (freight) of property from the vendor directly to Stanford are not subject to tax if the property is transported by common carrier and the amount charged is the cost of the transportation. \"Shipping and Handling\" is not a separately stated charge. Note: Handling is taxable. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 7).\nIn general, food products purchased as groceries are exempt except for the following items which are taxable: alcoholic or carbonated beverages, dietary supplements, meals consumed on the seller's premises, hot prepared foods and food served at places charging admission, which are taxable. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 5).\nA separate charge for an OPTIONAL software maintenance agreement is 50 percent taxable if the purchase includes delivery of any physical products during the term of the agreement (for example, purchaser receives software updates on CD). The tax will be charged at the time the invoice is paid. For more information, refer to Publication 119: Warranties and Maintenance Agreements.\nAn optional warranty or maintenance agreement is a contract that the purchaser may choose to purchase for an additional charge. If the product can be purchased without buying the warranty, the warranty is optional. (e.g., an extended repair warranty for a computer or electronic device, an extended mileage warranty for a car, a service plan for a refrigerator). For more information, refer to Publication 119: Warranties and Maintenance Agreements.\nElectronically delivered, commercially available, non-customized computer programs where no tangible media such as a CD or DVD is received. Vendor's documents should state that the product is delivered electronically.\nComputer programs prepared to the special order of Stanford are non-taxable. Separately stated service charges for modification to an existing prewritten program are also exempt only to the extent of the modification. Excluded are non-custom computer programs. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 14).\nPrescription medicines are non-taxable if 1) prescribed for human use and dispensed by a registered pharmacist, 2) furnished by or sold to a licensed medical professional for patient treatment; 3) furnished by a health facility pursuant to the order of a licensed physician or,4) furnished by a government-operated medical facility. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 5).\nPatents/licenses/copyright/royalties/other fees\nOriginal works of art purchased for free public display in museums are non-taxable. For more information, refer to Sales and Use Tax Guidelines (page 4).\nAs a research institution, certain purchases made by Stanford are eligible for a reduced California sales tax rate. iProcurement automatically determines eligibility of requisitions that qualify for the tax discount. Submit a Support Request to inquire about eligibility for this tax discount. \nFor more information on exemptions, please refer to CDTFA Publication 61: Sales and Use Taxes: Exemptions and Exclusions.\nNote: The \"System Generated Tax Exemption\" category used in iProcurement is reserved for Oracle system use only. Please do not select when specifying tax status. This tax exempt category is programatically assigned by the system when a line item meets special non-taxable criteria.\nDisclaimer: Stanford University does not offer personal tax advice. Nothing on this website shall be construed as the offering of tax advice. Stanford recommends seeking professional tax"}

Health hazards range from mild irritation to carcinogenicity. Physical hazards, such as flammability and reactivity, can also have serious consequences. This section provides information on best practices for the use and storage of chemicals for laboratories.\nCal/OSHA regulations require all laboratories using hazardous chemicals to take specific safety measures to ensure safe lab operations.\nThis topic provides guidance to PIs, laboratory supervisors, and lab personnel on compliance with the institutional Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP). If you\u2019re looking for information on Toxic Gas, read about it in the Hazardous Materials topic.\nResponsibilities\nIt is the joint responsibility of the PI or laboratory supervisor and the laboratory personnel to implement the CHP. (Review laboratory safety responsibilities on the Principal Investigator and Lab Manager role pages.)\nReview this topic, as well as the Lab Safety topic, to establish the following key elements of the institutional CHP:\nSafety training\nGeneral lab practices\nStandard Operating Procedures\nRequired work approvals\nLaboratory inspections\nEmergency procedures\nCreating a Laboratory-Specific Chemical Safety Plan:\nTo aid in compiling your lab\u2019s safety information, you have the option to create a Laboratory-Specific Chemical Safety Plan. To do so:\nPrint out a Laboratory Chemical Safety Plan. (Note that this document is pre-formatted for double-sided printing.)\nAdd on lab-specific safety documents, which can be created using the Toolkit (e.g. standard operating procedures, required work approvals, safety training records, and laboratory inspections records).\nEH&S is available to assist with preparation and/or review of your Laboratory-Specific Chemical Safety Plan. Please contact the Safety & Compliance Officer for your building."}

If salary expenditures are expected, the Organization Suspense Account (OSA) PTA and OSA Sweep PTA must also be provided. The specific award type for each is limited to an allowed list, shown below. See Topic Overview: Organization Code Hierarchy Change Requests and How To: Request Changes to Suspense Account PTAs.\nPrior to 2023 award type limitations were not enforced, so some PTAs currently associated with orgs may be of a different award type. Moving forward, all new org setups and all updates to existing selections must use an allowed award type for system validation. The best practice is to review all suspense accounts and update them to the allowed award types.\nTable of allowed award types by suspense account type\nThe Organization Code Hierarchy Tool (new org code requests) and Suspense Account Query Tool (change requests) are restricted to only accept the award types listed below.\nOSA PTA OSA SWEEP PTA A/P DEFAULT PTA \nCLR_ORG_SAL_SUSPENSE\tAUX%\tAUX%\t\n\tDES%\tCLR_CLEARING\t\n\tGEN%\tCLR_EXP_ALLOC\t\n\t\tCLR_ORG_SUSPENSE\t\n\t\tCLR_TRAVEL_CARD\t\n\t\tDES%"}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/resource/living-wage-and-benefit-guidelines", "text": "Living Wage and Benefit Guidelines\nSince September 1, 2007, Stanford University has recognized the importance of paying a living wage to all service workers at the university, whether they are directly employed by Stanford or by suppliers and contractors. This applies to services performed on the core campus premises (including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) that Stanford might otherwise perform with directly hired hourly paid employees, and to supplier/contractor employees not represented under a collective bargaining relationship.\nOverview\nStanford recognizes that a living wage and other benefits enhance the quality of an individual's work experience. Through these guidelines, Stanford seeks to establish minimum pay, access to healthcare benefits and compensated time off for service workers. These guidelines are not intended to prevent suppliers/contractors from providing wages and benefits in excess of the minimums created here.\nThe wage guidelines are two-tiered, with an identified minimum living wage established if the employer provides a health plan, and a higher minimum living wage required if no health benefits are provided. The guidelines establish at least 10 compensated days off annually for full time employees who have worked for the supplier or contractor for at least 1 year. This includes holidays and other paid time off such as vacations, sick and personal days.\nIn addition, suppliers and contractors shall comply with state and federal law in providing employees with a safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.\nWhen Stanford changes suppliers or contractors, it will encourage the new supplier or contractor to fill any existing vacancies by interviewing and considering for hire qualified employees of the previous supplier or contractor.\nStanford further recognizes that federal law provides that \"employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities...\" Stanford will continue to honor these rights.\nThe wage and benefit levels set under these guidelines will be reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted as appropriate based on recommendations from University Human Resources. The recommendations will be submitted to the President for his final decision.\nMinimum Living Wage Rates\nEffective Dates With Health Benefits Without Health Benefits \n12/1/2023- 9/30/2024\t$19.53\t$22.19\t\n10/1/2022 - 11/30/2023\t$18.55\t$21.08\t\n10/1/2021 \u2013 9/30/2022\t$17.26\t$19.61\t\n10/1/2020 \u2013 9/30/2021\t$16.44\t$18.68\t\n10/1/2019 \u2013 9/30/2020\t$15.88\t$18.05\t\n10/1/2018 \u2013 9/30/2019\t$15.31\t$17.40\t\n10/1/2017 \u2013 9/30/2018\t$14.55\t$16.54\t\n10/1/2016 \u2013 9/30/2017\t$14.06\t$15.97\t\nApplicability\nThese guidelines apply to suppliers and contractors whose employees provide any services, including but not limited to, maintenance, grounds keeping, housing and food services and general administrative jobs directly to Stanford University* when all of the following conditions are met:\nThe workers are employees of suppliers/contractors with agreements with Stanford University.\nSuch workers are regular or temporary employees of the supplier/contractor.\nSuch workers are not represented under any existing collective bargaining relationship.\nThe aggregate value of the contract(s) exceeds $100,000 per year. \nThis means that single suppliers/contractors with several small contracts that are individually smaller than $100,000 but when totaled are at or above $100,000 will be covered by this policy.\n*Excludes tenants or other entities doing business on university-owned land.

Authority Manager needs to be modified to ensure the right level of control (separation of duties).\nProcess:\nReview existing authority for the org(s) that are being changed (Tip: Choose \u201cFind an Organization\u201d in Authority Manager and/or choose \u201cOracle BI Authority Reports\u201d to review the authority set up for everyone in the organization).\nAfter the new desired org structure is defined, determine what changes are needed to achieve the desired level of authority (including access to salary data).\nWhen the new orgs are available in Authority Manager, update authority as desired.\nEnsure financial approvals are reviewed and updated as needed.\nNote: If an individual needs to retain authority that they would lose for a period of time after the org change is complete (e.g. to complete year-end activities), negotiate retaining authority for the required time period with the org owner.\nNote: If an entire org is moving intact, no changes may be necessary.\nPlan to change Authority Manager one month before change. Note: In many cases, changes to Authority Manager cannot be made until the new org(s) are created or the org(s) are moved. PeopleSoft Request creation/changes to position management for the updated leaf org to feed over to the employee job record. Ensure the employee job record reflects the correct leaf org. Employees on parent orgs will fail to load into Oracle Financials, affecting access and possibly cause inaccurate payroll charges. In HRMS PeopleSoft, Position Management timing and coordination within the department is critical since you cannot sequence in Position Management (e.g., process two transactions on the same effective date). Timing of creation/ changes defined by Payroll Schedules and Deadlines Labor Schedules Can be adjusted at any time, but labor schedules for new/changed orgs should be created in line with the activation of the org code hierarchy in Oracle Financials. If the PTA(s) that employees are charged to are not changing (i.,e., if the org is moving intact), then changes to labor schedules may not be needed; view Learn About System: Labor Schedules.\nIf the PTA(s) that employees are charged to are not changing (i.,e., if the org is moving intact), then changes to labor schedules may not be needed.\nOnce the org code hierarchy is activated in Oracle Financials. Organization Suspense Accounts (OSAs) An Organization Suspense Account (OSA) is a holding account, set up for every department to account for payroll transaction errors. The OSA and org mapping is maintained in Oracle Financials by the Systems and Reporting Operations (SRO) team. To learn or change the OSA for an org, use the Oracle Inquiry Tools: Suspense Account Query. Accounts Payable (AP) Default PTA An Organization AP Default PTA is a holding account, set up for every department to account for non-payroll transaction errors. The AP Default PTA and org mapping is maintained in Oracle Financials by the Systems and Reporting Operations (SRO) team. To learn or change the AP Default PTA for an org, see Learn About: Suspense Account Query Tool. Revenue/Fund Balance Submit a support request to the Office of the Treasurer if revenue is impacted. If revenue is being automatically posted, then Oracle Financials will need to be updated to correct PFOO (object code or 4****). If revenue/fund balances are impacted in the org, determine updates needed to manage/report revenue as desired. Two week lead time to request change. Global Determine if the org change impacts a global entity; consult with the Global Business Services team as needed. POs/Blanket POs Review active POs (not finally closed and no payment activity in 18-24 months) and determine if PTA needs to be updated (e.g., if PTA is no longer active, invoices will not be paid). Contracts (SmartMart Contracts) Look up purchase requisitions that have a contract; or long term obligation (e.g., a lease, term obligation, contract to a third part supplier). Review active contracts by running Purchase Requisition Report in OBI, and include the \u201cPurchase Req Line Contract Required Indicator\u201d field. Vendors Determine if there is going to be a change in the existing vendor relationship (e.g., if contacts change, or an org is moved to another BU and a different vendor is used for the same service). PCards/TCards Review existing cards and PCards to determine if a change to the guarantee PTA associated is needed, if a change to the verifier or custodian is needed. Determine if a new card needs to be issued. Run the OBI Credit Card Transaction - Aging Report to determine what transactions are in process, and clear them prior to org change. Also review credit card transactions to determine if subscriptions or other automatic payments will be impacted. Two weeks - one month prior to change Expense Request Transactions/ Non-PO Payments (ERs, PRs, VRs) Review active transactions to determine if PTA changes are needed. Run the OBI Expense Requests - Aging Report to determine what transactions are in process and submit or delete them prior to org change. Review transactions to determine if subscriptions, memberships, etc. need to be moved to a new PTA. Two weeks - one month prior to change Contingent Workforce (CardinalTemps and Independent Contractor) Ensure contingent workers (temp labor and independent contractors) are moved to the updated org, if needed. For independent contractors (not through CardinalTemps), please follow the Contracts process above. One month prior org change Reporting (Verification) Verify org changes and run OBI reports for expenses, revenue and budgets, to determine if the org structure is capturing financials as desired. If discrepancies are found in OBI, submit a support request. One day after org changes are made in Oracle Reporting Historical Data (OBI) Historical attributes in OBI Ad Hoc Reporting can be used to see data in original org or PTA.

Accordingly, those who are making purchases on behalf of or doing business with the university, must follow the applicable purchasing policies and guidelines. Administrative Guide Chapter 5: Purchasing and Payments provides more information about purchasing at Stanford. The procedures described below, and included throughout this site, are intended to guide the university community toward compliant, effective, and efficient purchasing processes. \nGuiding Principles\nCompliant\nPurchasing activity must be compliant with federal, state, local, and university policies. Stanford\u2019s Administrative Guide Memo outlines general policies for the purchase of major and minor construction, equipment, supplies, and services. Key considerations for compliance include the following:\nProper authority over purchasing activities\nPrice reasonableness and competition\nAdministrative Guide Policy 1.5.2: Staff Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest and Research Policy Handbook 4.1: Faculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment and Interest\nManaged providers of specific goods and services\nFunding source (including federal and sponsored funds). See also Proper Use of Funds.\nGovernment licensing requirements and restricted purchases\nBiological and hazardous materials\nPurchasing method\nLocal, state, and federal tax. See: Sales and Use Tax and Tax Compliance at Stanford\nIf a purchase is identified as non-compliant, Stanford may consider the acquisition effort null and void and decline to pay any invoice that might be issued. Stanford officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, the Assistant Vice President of Procurement Services, and those to whom the Assistant Vice President of Procurement Services has delegated authority, including operations managers, supervisors, and buyers, may refuse to ratify such transactions. In such a case, the supplier may look to the individual placing the order for payment or reimbursement.\nSee Business and Travel Expense Policies for a list of some, but not all, expenses that are considered non-permissible expenses. Unless specifically noted, listed items may not be purchased or reimbursed through any method, regardless of the funding source. \nResponsible\nResponsible purchasing is the acquisition of goods and services that meet the business and research needs of the consumer while also being environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and ethically sourced. It is Stanford's preference to purchase and use environmentally preferable products whenever they perform satisfactorily and can be acquired at similar total value. Read Stanford\u2019s Responsible Purchasing policy to learn more.\nAppropriate\nDeans, department chairs, directors, principal investigators, and other university officials are responsible for appropriate stewardship of university resources. As such, individuals using university resources for business, travel expenses, and/or are purchasing items to be owned by Stanford share the responsibility of ensuring that these resources are used appropriately, support the university mission and comply with university policies, applicable laws, and regulations and sponsor and donor restrictions. This applies to all purchasing activities as well as Business and Travel Expense reimbursement. \nPersonal expenses and purchases that are not made on behalf of the university or for use by the university are not permitted. These may be considered fraudulent transactions. Purchases must be for the use and benefit of Stanford University, regardless of intent to reimburse Stanford. If any Stanford user associated with the purchase commits purposeful fraudulent or other inappropriate behavior regarding the proper use of the requisitioning and purchasing process, it will be considered serious misconduct and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\nRefer to Administrative Guide Guides 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities and 5.1.1: Procurement Policies for more information."}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/purchasing-contracts/categories-purchases", "text": "Categories of Purchases\nNote: To align with IRS guidelines, the university policy was clarified that all gift cards are taxable when provided as gifts, regardless of amount. See the updated gift policy as of July 20, 2023 for additional guidance on employee gifts.\nGift cards should only be provided in support of an identified university business purpose. Gift cards, including electronic gift cards, can be used for human subject payments, conference meals, event or research study prizes, or employee appreciation gifts. Stanford-branded merchandise or other tangible items, including food, are strongly encouraged instead of gift cards as employee gifts.\nRefer to the following university policies:\nAdministrative Guide Policy 2.2.10: Gifts and Awards for University Employees\nAdministrative Guide Policy 5.4.2: Business and Travel Expenses\nResearch Policy Handbook 13.1 Gift vs. Sponsored Projects and Distinctions from Other Forms of Funding\nTax Implications\nAll gift cards, regardless of type or amount, are taxable from the first dollar and for the entire value, even when given as employee gifts. The university strongly encourages departments to purchase tangible goods, such as Stanford-branded merchandise. This minimizes the tax burden for the recipient and the risks associated with storing and handling gift cards. \nTax reporting guidance:\nGift cards provided to employees: Provide recipient details with the Expense Request or PCard transaction and use the appropriate taxable gift expenditure type. \nSee: How-To: Verify PCard Transactions or Beneficiaries in ERS for Expense Reimbursements. \nGift cards provided to human subjects: When gift cards are used as incentives to human subjects, they are treated as taxable income. Follow guidance on Paying Human Subjects to appropriately tax report in these instances.\nPurchasing Methods\nIt is recommended that purchases of gift cards of a total amount less than $5,000 be made using a Purchasing Card (PCard). Other methods of purchasing gift cards for university business include using personal funds and getting reimbursed through an expense report, requesting an advance (for human subjects only), or a non-PO payment request. Please note that Stanford\u2019s Amazon Business account does not support the purchasing of gift cards.\nRefer to the table below for specific gift card use cases and appropriate purchasing methods. \nGift Card Use Case Stanford Purchasing Card (PCard) Expense Requests - Expense Report Expense Requests - Advance \nNon-Catalog Requisition (Purchase Order)\nExpense Requests - Non PO Payment \nHuman Subject Payments - Visitors Yes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tN/A - used for direct human subject payments only.\t\nHuman Subject Payments - Employees Tangible gifts or non-PO payment are preferred. See more information on paying human subjects.\t\nEmployee Gifts Yes\tYes\tNo\tNot recommended. Instead, use other method\tNo\t\nGift Card Best Practices \nTo safeguard university assets, the following best practices are recommended when purchasing and stewarding gift cards:\nStoring and Tracking: Store gift cards securely as these are treated as cash. Each gift card should be distributed to its intended recipient shortly after purchase. Track all gift card recipients and include the name of recipient and amount received in backup documentation to be stored locally and attached to applicable transactions. This enables purchasing traceability and alignment with financial stewardship expectations. \nDocumentation: For Human Subject gift card payments, attach the Human Subject Incentive Certification Form to the transaction as backup documentation. Doing so ensures accurate record-keeping, traceability and transactional integrity. \nTiming: Process transactions accurately and within a timely manner to ensure that the purchase is properly applied to the PTA that was charged.\nSupport: Contact the Financial Support Center for assistance. \nGift Card Purchases Exceeding $5,000\nThere are occasions when departments need to purchase gift cards in bulk for later distribution to individuals for Human Subjects participating in forthcoming research studies. When purchasing bulk gift cards for human subjects totaling $5,000 or more, departments may use an iProcurement Non-catalog Requisition.\nBulk purchases of gift cards for employees are highly discouraged. If bulk purchases for employee gift cards are still required, those may be purchased with a PCard but please note that each gift card must have an intended recipient and the recipient\u2019s information must be included with the transaction. \nStorage of large purchases of gift cards presents a risk to the university. Gift cards must be appropriately secured and tracked in the same manner as cash. Departments must ensure proper local controls are in place for dual custody of the gift cards, throughout the purchasing, storage and distribution processes. \nOptional Gift Card Supplier - Blackhawk Network Inc \nThere are many programs available for departments to purchase gift cards. Procurement Services has worked with Blackhawk Network Inc to support bulk purchases of gift cards for human subjects. To set up a Blackhawk Network Inc account, departments need to contact the Stanford Account Manager, Ron Olsen, to receive login credentials for the Hawk Marketplace website to put in an order and obtain an invoice document. To process this transaction, departments should create an iProcurement Non-catalog Requisition. Once the purchase order (PO) is created, departments will need to upload the invoice document to the PO for processing and payment."}

These iBudgets journals are for planning purposes and only affect Expense Control information on Expenditure Detail Reports. New/Increase/Decrease journals do not have to balance. \nReallocation Journal\nUsed to move budget (expense control) amounts from one PTA to another or from one expenditure type to other expenditure types. Reallocation journals have to balance (\u201cFrom\u201d equals \u201cTo\u201d) and no more than two PTAs may be used, although one side of the transaction may include many different expenditure types if the other side only includes one expenditure type.\nTransactions may be for planning purposes only or may be coupled with a related fund transfer journal to move expense control and actual funding. \nUpload Journals\nEnables upload of journals from an Excel spreadsheet to the database using a preformatted template.

If an approver finds anything wrong with a journal, they must reject the journal in order to return it to the originator for modification and re-routing.\nThe department originator and approver are responsible for ensuring that the expenditures are appropriate under the terms of the award.\nSponsor's award terms and conditions take precedence unless they are less restrictive than Stanford's policy.\nTo learn more about the approval process, refer to Topic Overview: Financial Transaction Approval.\nJournals Awaiting Approval at Month-End\nJournal originators are responsible for monitoring the approval status of their journals. Journals must be completely approved, including end-routes, by the cut-off date each month to be included in the month's activities. For more information, refer to Topic Overview: Month-End Close, the Month-End Close Schedule.\nAt the end of each month, the Financial Management Consulting & Support \u2013 Systems and Reporting Operations (S&RO) group will change the period of any unapproved journals in the system to the following month (i.e., the period for any November journals not approved by the cut-off will automatically be changed to December).

Workflow Notifications are the primary method of communicating with financial transaction approvers that a transaction requires their review and/or approval. This system page focuses on Oracle Workflow Notifications for financial approvers.\nMost transactions generated in Oracle Financials must be approved by a person or persons with the appropriate financial authority before they are considered complete. If the originator of a transaction does not have adequate financial authority to fully approve the transaction, it will be routed to an authorized approver for review and approval. Oracle Financials uses the account structure to identify authorized approvers based on the PTA account(s) included in the transaction. For more information, refer to Topic Overview: Financial Transaction Approval.\nOracle Workflow Notifications communicate with financial approvers by sending email notifications. Notifications contain information about the transaction and may request users to take approval action or provide users with FYI-only information. \nWorkflow Notification emails prompt approvers to log in to Oracle Workflow Notifications to review, approve, or return/reject transactions from their approval Worklist.\nAnyone with a Stanford University ID (SUNET ID) can log in to Oracle Financials and gain access to Workflow Notifications. The Workflow Notification Worklist will be blank unless you are an authorized transaction approver and you have notifications that require action. \nFrom the Oracle Home page, there are three different ways to access Workflow Notifications:\nCenter of the Home Page: The most recent three open notifications in an approver's Worklist display in the center of the Home Page.

For example, a Technical Services agreement is used for building a website, while a Consulting agreement is used when a consultant advises Stanford on how to improve the website that is being built.\nExamples of consulting services could include management and leadership consulting, strategic planning, user experience (UX), user interface (UI), or other software/network/internet consulting. \tSee additional guidance about Independent Contractors/ Consultants on this page. \t\nHotel/Venue\tThe supplier will provide room(s) and/or event space for a specific single department event.\t\nRefer to the Group Room Blocks section on the Topic Overview: Lodging page for guidance on booking a room block with hotels that have an existing Master Service Agreement (MSA) with Stanford.

In summary:\nGuiding Principles \nSupporting University Travelers: In order for Stanford to be able to provide support to its faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and students when they are traveling on university-sponsored business, the university maintains a Travel Registry.\nStewardship of Resources: Individuals using university resources for business or travel expenses and/or purchasing items to be owned by Stanford share the responsibility of ensuring that these resources are used appropriately, support the university mission and comply with university policies, applicable laws and regulations and sponsor and donor restrictions. Individuals are expected to spend appropriately and expenses must be reasonable and necessary. Departments may uphold more restrictive guidance than the university at local discretion.\nIRS Regulations \nThe university reimburses individuals under the IRS Accountable Plan when the IRS regulations are met. Under this plan, the reimbursement is not taxable as income to the employee if the expense has a business connection and is also submitted in a timely manner.\nTo prevent expenses from being treated as taxable income, a transaction must be prepared and submitted into the Expense Requests system in Oracle Financials with all appropriate receipts or backup documentation within 60 days after the end of travel (for travel expenses), the expense posted date (for non travel expenses), or expected clearing date (for advances). See Topic Overview: Managing Aging and Outstanding Expense Transactions for information on how to manage expense reports, Purchasing Card, Travel Card, and advance transactions with regard to timing.\nTravel and business expenses that do not reflect good stewardship of university resources, are found to benefit the individual at the expense of the university and/or are deemed excessive or fraudulent will be subject to further review by the appropriate office (e.g., Office of Chief Risk Officer or School/Unit Office), as outlined in Administrative Guide Policy 3.5.1: Financial Irregularities.\nFunding Source \nA key consideration in the proper stewardship of university resources is ensuring that the funding source is appropriate to use for the expense. Funding sources such as individual or corporate donors, government agencies, non-government sponsors and tuition have varying restrictions for their use. The federal government has mandated that no alcohol may be charged as either a direct or indirect expense of federally sponsored projects. Consequently, alcohol cannot be charged to a federal grant or contract account under any circumstances. \nBusiness and travel expenses that will be charged to restricted or sponsored awards, including costs of lodging, meals and incidental expenses, must be reasonable, allowable, necessary to the award and consistent with university policies. For example, the use of the per diem method is required when travel meal expenses will be charged to a sponsored award. Certain expenditures, such as business entertainment, alcohol and eligible business-class airfare, may be incurred within policy for university business or travel, and may be charged to an unrestricted account, but may not be charged directly to restricted or sponsored awards.\nUniversity-Sponsored Travel\nPer Administrative Guide Policy 5.4.2, university-sponsored travel is defined as when the university pays directly or reimburses individuals for travel expenses that are necessary and appropriate to conduct university business. This includes the use of any funding source for which the university has financial responsibility and accountability, including operating budgets, donor gifts, federally-sponsored grants and awards, and any other restricted or unrestricted fund. Student and postdoctoral scholar travel that is directly related to their individual course of study, or for which academic credit may be awarded, is considered university-sponsored travel, even if the travel is funded via their base financial support.\nUniversity-sponsored travel may occur within or outside of the local area. Travel is considered outside of the local area when the destination is 50 miles or more one way from the traveler\u2019s home or Stanford\u2019s historic campus, whichever is greater. This definition is applicable to some travel expense policies, for example, hotel lodging reimbursement, where the university will only pay for hotel lodging expenses when the trip is outside of the local area.\nEmployee Travel to a Stanford Work Location\nFor employees in a hybrid work arrangement, travel between an employee\u2019s telecommuting worksite and their Primary Stanford Work Location is considered part of an employee\u2019s normal commute and associated expenses are not reimbursable. For details, see Administrative Guide Policy 2.1.20: Hybrid (Telecommuting) Work Arrangements\nFor employees in a remote work arrangement whose residence is within the defined 10-county area*, travel to a Stanford Work Location will not be reimbursed because the remote arrangement is at the employee\u2019s request and there is space available for the employee to work on campus. See Administrative Guide Policy 2.1.21: Remote Work Arrangements.\nFor Remote employees outside of the 10-county area, Stanford will reimburse expenses for occasional, required travel to a Stanford Work Location as long as the travel is necessarily incurred and the employee receives prior approval by the employee\u2019s department/manager. In these instances, the guidelines for booking and reimbursement of business travel apply. For details, see Administrative Guide Policy 2.1.21 Remote Work Arrangements.\n*The 10-county area includes all of the following counties: Santa Clara County, San Mateo County, San Francisco County, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Marin County, Napa County, Sonoma County, Solano County, or Santa Cruz County.\nSplit or Partially Funded Travel\nWhen travel expenses for Stanford faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars or students will be shared by Stanford University and one or more external organizations, even if only a minority of the travel expenses are sponsored by Stanford, the trip is considered split.\nSplit travel is considered university-sponsored travel and any portion of travel that Stanford pays for must follow Business and Travel Expense Policies detailed here and in Administrative Guide Policy 5.4.2. Stanford Travel booking channels may be used for travel expenses that are being paid for by Stanford. All booking policies apply, including itinerary forwarding.\nIf it is not easy to separate out the costs that will be covered by the external party, the Stanford Travel Card may be used to pay for the total cost of the trip, then Stanford must be reimbursed by the traveler or travel arranger for the external party portion. See How To Return Personal Expenses Charged to a Travel Card.\nFully Externally-sponsored Travel\nWhen an outside institution or entity asks Stanford faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars or students to travel on that organization\u2019s behalf and provides full payment for those travel expenses, the trip is considered fully externally-sponsored, also referred to as third party travel.\nStanford University resources may not be used to book, purchase or reimburse expenses for fully externally-sponsored travel. In these instances, the use of the Stanford Travel Card and advances is prohibited, and travel arrangements may not be booked via Stanford Travel booking channels.\nCosts not covered by the external organization, including extra costs incurred for personal upgrades or to enhance travel options, cannot be reimbursed by Stanford as the trip's purpose serves the external organization.\nPersonal Travel\nWhen a personal component of travel is added to a business trip, the university will only pay for or reimburse the costs of the business component. The charge that would have been incurred without that personal component must be documented through a fare comparison at the time of booking in order to appropriately process the reimbursement.\nThe Travel Card may be used to pay for trips that include a component of personal travel that may not be easily separated from the booking, but it may not be used to purchase trips that are exclusively personal. In cases where the Travel Card is used to purchase trips with a personal component, the individual is responsible for reimbursing the university for the extra cost."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/donor-gifts", "text": "Donor Gifts\nAs described below, donors expect that their expendable gifts and the payout on their endowment gifts will be spent in a timely manner and in accordance with the gift terms. It is important to ensure that donors have confidence that the university will use their gifts in a way that the donor intended in furtherance of the university\u2019s educational, research, and patient care missions. Below are several resources and best practices that support the stewardship of donor gifts and help ensure that gifts are spent in accordance with the donor\u2019s terms as documented in the fund authorization. \nDonor Gift Terms\nDonor gifts should be spent according to the donor\u2019s intentions - which are referred to as the \u201cgift terms.\u201d Gift terms are available in the Fund Authorization for the fund in which the gift is allocated, which can be found in the OBI Dashboard: Revenue and Fund Management (RFM) Award at a Glance tab, the Fund Authorization, or via the Oracle Financials Inquiry Tools through the Fund Title Query tool.\nPlease note that older funds may not have the full donor documentation represented in the fund authorization; in these cases, contact FMS Fund Accounting for more information. \nFund Authorization should be reviewed regularly by department fund managers to ensure that fund terms are understood and that the annual spending is consistent with the specific wording in the documentation. \nSpending or Transferring Donor Gifts\nIt is critical to understand exactly how gift funds were spent or transferred and to have clear and complete documentation. Utilizing the system infrastructure to set up projects and tasks with appropriate titles makes it easy to see how funds are being used. Document transfers with appropriate business justifications, avoiding jargon and acronyms. \nOriginators and approvers of financial transactions should understand and confirm that the expenditure is consistent with the gift terms (use the Expenditure Transaction Approval Checklist and Cost Transfer Approval Checklist).\nFund managers who are unsure or concerned about whether the expense or transfer of the gift funds is in line with the donor gift terms should reach out for assistance. Resources include first consulting the department\u2019s school or unit Dean\u2019s Office, and the Donor Relations Officer, and then FMS Fund Accounting. There are also anonymous avenues for support including through the Ethics and Compliance Helpline and the Ombuds Office.\nChanged Terms of Donor Gifts\nNew, changed, or revised terms must be reflected in an award's fund authorization. When a department receives a document or other communication from a faculty member, staff member, or donor requesting that the terms or title of an expendable gift or endowment be changed either temporarily or permanently, departments should contact the Restricted Funds Group in the Office of Planned Giving in the Office of Development (OOD) and then FMS Fund Accounting. These groups can ensure that the newly added, changed, or modified terms are valid and determine if a new signed donor gift agreement is required. Documentation related to a gift fund that changes the fund terms or fund title should be saved in the appropriate file for the funds, which can be facilitated by Fund Accounting. Fund Accounting will also update the Fund Authorization with the updated terms.\nA faculty member may have a conversation with a donor where they verbally discuss changes to the use of a gift. It is critical that any revised terms for the gift be documented to ensure alignment with the donor\u2019s intent. Conversations can be forgotten or not communicated to parties that administer the fund. The documentation of changes to the gift terms provides the opportunity for the donor to confirm the terms of the gift that can then be added to the fund authorization and shared with colleagues that manage and administer the fund. Without an official change to the donor agreement and fund authorization that typically involves written acceptance by the donor and an authorized representative of Stanford, it is not permissible to use gift funds in any way other than that described in the fund authorization. Please contact the Restricted Funds Group in OOD\u2019s Office of Planned Giving and then FMS Fund Accounting team for more information.\nOrder of Spending\nWhen selecting a source of funding, it is usually best practice to use the most restricted funding available first. This practice avoids funds going unused over a longer period of time. Using the most restrictive funds first will help steward the \u201charder to use\u201d gifts and provide more flexibility for other needs going forward.\nExamples:\nResearch project funding sources: If there are two funding sources available: one which is specific to a research project and another which is for the professor's research in general, first use the specific fund for the research project identified in the gift document. Once that is expended fully, the research project's expenses can then be charged to the more general fund. \nStudent fellowships: Rather than automatically reassigning a student to receive a particular fellowship each year, consider whether it is appropriate to reassign the student to a more specific funding source if their research, areas of study, or career plans have changed.\nFunds without contingency language: If there are two fund sources available for a faculty member, one that states the chair of the department may use the fund should the faculty member leave and one without contingency language, consider spending the fund without contingency language first. \nView the Resource: Decision Tree: Order of Spending Sponsored Funds.\nTimely Use of Donor Gifts\nDonors typically expect that expendable gifts will be used within a certain period of time and that payout from endowed funds will generally be used on an annual basis.\nThe best practice is to regularly, and at least annually, monitor expendable and endowment income fund balances to ensure monies are being spent in a timely manner. \nFor endowment funds the OBI Revenue and Fund Management Reporting > Unused and Underwater Endowment Funds Dashboard will help you identify endowment funds that are accumulating unspent income. \nFor expendable funds the OBI Revenue and Fund Management Reporting > Fund Trend Report will help you identify funds that are not being spent over time, resulting in growing fund balances.\nEnsure that there is a plan in place for unspent expendable gifts or payout on endowed funds for the immediate or near-term use of these monies unless the gift terms indicate otherwise.\nAny expendable gift fund or endowment payout balance that remains unspent after two years should be reviewed with the help of the appropriate Donation Relations Officer. Once a fund is fully spent down, the fund status should be shifted from \u201cActive\u201d to \u201cClosed.\u201d\nWhen Faculty or Other Fund Owners Become Unavailable\nIf a unit anticipates a faculty\u2019s (or other fund owner\u2019s) retirement or departure, to the extent appropriate and feasible, repurpose funds under their management. Once a faculty member leaves Stanford, any funds limited to their use (i.e. the faculty member is mentioned by name in the fund authorization) may become unusable. As a result, to the extent possible, prior to their departure, take steps to use funds that are restricted to that faculty member's use and/or develop a plan for future use. Reach out to the appropriate Donor Relations Officer or Fund Accounting teams as soon as you are aware of a potential retirement or departure. These teams can work with the faculty member (or other fund owner) to help transition the funds or to verify if there\u2019s appropriate alternative use.\nIn the School of Medicine (SoM), contact the Director of Finance and Administration for the department; they will work with the SoM Controller's Office to determine the most appropriate assignment. If no reassignment can be made, they will work with Medical Center Development to perform outreach to donors when necessary.\nNet Investment Income Excise Tax Charges\nStanford Financial Management Services manages the tracking and charging of NII excise tax charges on gifts of securities. The net investment income (NII) excise tax was introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and applies to investment income (dividends, interest, rents, etc.) and realized gains (including gains on appreciated gift securities). The tax became effective September 1, 2018. \nBeginning in FY24, monthly NII excise tax charges are charged to a general fund budget award for donor gifts of appreciated securities received that have a gift value of less than $500,000. Excise tax charges for gifts with a value of $500,000 or greater will continue to be charged to the award allocation.\nSchools and units who receive gifts of securities subject to the NII excise tax will see charges to the applicable awards typically in the same month close as the receipt of the gift. \nDesignated budget officers and finance managers have access, which is granted through Authority Manager, to view these charges in the Gift Securities Net Investment Income Excise Tax report located in the Other Financial Reports section of the OBI Financial Reporting Directory. Gifts of other types of investments, for example stocks being held or Limited Liability Partnerships received, may produce an NII excise tax event, though this type of excise tax is not included in the report. \nFor assistance with OBI Financial Reporting, submit a support request.\nFor questions about NII excise tax charges, contact the assigned Fund Accountant."}

Refer to How to: Clear a Fund Overdraft at Year-End for more information.\nClearing of Organization Suspense Accounts\nAn organization suspense account (OSA) is a PTA assigned to every organization (org) to capture payroll transactions when they fail to post successfully to their original PTA. Departments are required to clear OSAs soon after payroll posts in Oracle Financials or by the OSA clearing deadlines; any remaining transactions after the deadlines are moved to that department's OSA Sweep PTA and incur a $35 fee per impacted payroll line.\nDuring year-end close, departments should clear all transactions on their OSA through the final (Aug. 31) pay period via a fully submitted and approved labor distribution adjustment by the published YEC deadline. Otherwise, unapproved adjustments will carry over into the new fiscal year. OSA sweep fees are waived for the last sweep of the fiscal year.\nTo clear all transactions posted to OSAs (AAQxx with suspense expenditure type 51610), including vacation earnings (SOV/VCR) and retro salary payments for previous pay periods, refer to How to: Identify and Clear Organization Suspense Accounts (OSAs) for Labor.\nTo view suspense account information (AP Default PTA, OSA PTA, and OSA Sweep PTA) for your budget unit, use the Suspense Account Query Tool; only authorized budget officers may request changes to suspense accounts.\nTo monitor the status of LDA transactions, review them in the LDA system\u2019s At-a-Glance page or run the Labor Distribution Adjustments (Real-time) Report.\nQuestions/support: Submit a support request.\nExpenditure Type and Object Code Freeze\nDuring year-end close, there is a temporary freeze on the setup of new expenditure types and object codes and changes to existing ones.\nThe deadline for submitting requests is Aug. 1, 5 p.m.\nThe freeze is in effect beginning Sept. 1 and ending Oct. 31.\nSubmit requests using Request New Expenditure Type or Object Code and Request to Change Existing Expenditure Type or Object Code.\nImpact\nIf you submit a request by the Aug. 1 deadline, every effort is made to process your request in time for the August close.\nRequests submitted Aug. 2 through Oct. 31 are reviewed and processed beginning on Nov. 1 and are available only for the November month-end close.\nResources and support:\nFor details about the request and approval process, see Topic Overview: Request New or Change Existing Expenditure Type or Object Code.\nQuestions: Contact Contact Matt Savage at @email in Financial Analysis and Information Reporting.\nPTA Maintenance Blackout\nPTA Maintenance Blackout is a system control that prevents updates to PTAs during year-end close activities to ensure minimal interruption to back-end processes that may fail because of PTA updates. Please refrain from updating PTA segments during the blackout period. Refer to Learn About System: PTA Manager for information on creating, updating, and closing PTAs.\nReasons why transactions may fail during the blackout period:\nAward status: The status of the award was changed to Closed or On Hold\nProject status: The status of the project was changed to\nClosed PTA end dates: The end date of the project, task, or award was shortened. Note: Extending the end date of the project, task, or award is allowed.\nTransaction controls: An expenditure type was added to the Transaction Controls list, of a project or task, to prevent charges.\nPTA Carry Forward/Rollover Process\nAt the end of each fiscal year, project balances for all funds are consolidated and rolled into one General Ledger (PFOO) account for each fund. Balances are moved from this account back to the project for the new fiscal year by submitting a Carry Forward/Project Rollover request. This is typically done by auxiliary and service centers to facilitate annual budget and rate calculations.\nDetermining Fiscal Year-End Account Balances\nA fund\u2019s balance is determined by summing up all positive and negative project balances related to Expense and Revenue Object Codes 40000-59999 at the end of the fiscal year. The balance is automatically placed in the PFOO account 1000000-(FUND)-30001-ZZZZ.\nProjectFundObjectEnd FY Bal\n1234567\tALAAA\t42252\t-100\t\n1234567\tALAAA\t51501\t150\t\n1234567\tALAAA\t54801\t200\t\nWhat occurs automatically at the beginning of the fiscal year\nProjectFundObjectEnd FY Bal\n1000000\tALAAA\t30001\t250\t\nWhat will happen with the carry forward request\nProjectFundObjectEnd FY Bal\n1234567\tALAAA\t30001\t250\t\nTo identify account balances in account 1000000-(FUND)-30001-ZZZZ after fiscal year-end, select the OBI Revenue and Fund Management Dashboard > Fund Statement tab.\nRequesting Carry Forward of Project Balances\nAuxiliaries and service centers may request that balances are moved from account 1000000-(FUND)-30001-ZZZZ back to the project for the new fiscal year.\nAll projects and tasks associated with the award (FUND) are moved.\nRequests to move specific project balances within an award or to move partial balances are not accepted.\nReclassifications may be requested only after the initial Carry Forward/Rollover request is completed.\nThe Systems & Reporting Operations (S&RO) department will create appropriate journal entries to process the request.

Checks that cannot be processed in the J.P. Morgan Access Mobile Deposits app or by desktop deposit include checks drawn on Canadian or other international banks, or checks made payable in foreign currencies. Please deposit these at a Wells Fargo branch. \nThe following types can be processed in the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Access Mobile Deposits app and at a Wells Fargo Bank branch:\nPersonal checks\nBusiness checks\nU.S. Treasury/government checks\nTraveler\u2019s checks\nCashier's checks\nDomestic money orders \nAccepted from the U.S. Post Office, Western Union, MoneyGram, and American Express \nNot all money orders can be accepted via mobile deposit. If a money order is marked with \u201cmobile deposit prohibited,\u201d for example, please visit a Wells Fargo branch to deposit.\nProcess Same Day\nCash and check receipts should be deposited as soon as possible, preferably on the same day they are received. During any interim period between receipt and deposit, cash and checks should be secured in a cash box or other locked container with copies of sequentially numbered receipts listed on a cash and check log. Be aware of stale dates printed on checks. Even if no stale date is printed, checks automatically expire within 180 days. See How To: Process and Deposit Department Receipts.\nPreparing and Endorsing Checks\nEnsure check information is complete and meets deposit requirements. \nChecks must be payable in U.S. dollars and drawn on any U.S. bank. The check or money order should be made payable to Stanford University or any version of the official name: The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University. \nIf the check is not made payable to Stanford University, you will need to request a new check with Stanford included on the payee line of the check.\nIf a check intended for Stanford University is made payable to an individual, it may be refused for deposit by the bank and have a complicated impact on tax reporting for Stanford and the individual. In the event that this happens, the payer should reissue the check made payable to Stanford University.\nWhen checks are received, they should be immediately endorsed on the back with \"For Deposit Only to Stanford University\u201d and recorded in a department check receipts log. Handwritten endorsements are acceptable. \nAn endorsement stamp with this information may be ordered by submitting a support request to OOT. When ordering a new endorsement stamp, please include the name, department, and mailing address in the support request to expedite processing. \nEndorsement stamps or deposit slips that feature the location code 10001 should not be used and should be destroyed. \nEndorsement stamps featuring the Wells Fargo account number can only be used on checks that will be deposited at Wells Fargo branches or through dedicated location code desktop scanners. The Wells Fargo account number endorsement stamp cannot be used on checks deposited using the J.P. (JPM) Morgan mobile app because it will cause the deposit to fail. \nHigh volume depositors can request a universal stamp for check endorsements that does not include the bank account number. \nSee How To: Process and Deposit Department Receipts.\nUsing PTAE and PFOs\nDepositors should verify that the Project, Task, Award, and Expenditure Type (PTAE) or Project, Fund/Award, and Object Code (PFO) are appropriate for the account before making a deposit. Listing an incorrect PTA will cause a delay in processing and require further action on your part to claim the deposit on the Deposits and Receipts Manager system. To identify the correct PTAE/PFO, consult with your department budget or finance officer.\nAll transactions must include a PTA or PFO combined with an expenditure type or object code to be recorded in Oracle Financials. \nExpenditure types are used to record payments and expenses like salaries, purchases, business and travel expenses. \nObject codes are used to record incoming revenue, as well as assets, liabilities, and fund transfers.\nNon-Sponsored Receipts\nNon-sponsored project receipts made via cash may be hand-delivered to the appropriate office as indicated in their processing instructions. Contact the Department of Public Safety (650-723-9633) to set up a police escort if the amount is substantial or additional safety precautions are appropriate.\nChecks for non-sponsored project receipts may be sent to the correct department through interdepartmental mail after the check has been endorsed. See Contacts for Non-Sponsored Funding by School and Department. Sponsored receipts should be sent by USPS. Checks must be in a second sealed envelope inside the main envelope.\nFor sponsored projects, see How To: Process Sponsored Project Receipts.\nInternational Banks\nFor checks drawn on international/foreign banks in either USD or a foreign currency, take the endorsed check with the appropriate PTA printed on the front to a Wells Fargo Bank branch. A teller will accept the check and provide a receipt. It may take six to eight weeks for the check to be processed by the international bank and substantial fees will be deducted from the final deposit amount. For these reasons, foreign check acceptance is discouraged in favor of an electronic transfer of funds. For guidance, submit a support request to the Office of the Treasurer.\nStoring/Disposing of Checks\nAfter the checks have been successfully scanned on the mobile deposit app, please keep them locked in a secure place as they contain bank account information, which is considered high-risk data. Checks should be securely kept until a bank reconciliation is completed, after which they may be destroyed by shredding or an equivalent method.\nSupport\nDepartment managers can facilitate development and implementation of their own departmental procedures for handling cash and checks.\nFor assistance with cash and check deposits, submit a support request to the Office of the Treasurer.\nFor assistance with historical transaction support for deposits prior to November 23, 2022, including CASHNet data, submit a support request to Student Financial Services."}

Competitive purchasing practices include researching and comparing multiple providers of the goods or services, their prospective solutions, and pricing. To advance Stanford\u2019s ability to live its values, departments should leverage responsible purchasing practices whenever possible, taking into account the environmental and social impact of all purchases. \nA robust, competitive, and diverse supply base is essential to power the university and offers greater agility, innovation, and value. Departments can contact the Stanford Supplier Diversity Program to learn more about how to include diverse suppliers or independent contractors in their selection process.\nCertain pricing agreements, such as those available from Amazon Business and SmartMart Catalog Suppliers, have been previously established through a competitive bid process so Stanford purchasers can buy goods and services without additional proof of competition.\nValidation of Competition for Purchases $50,000 or Greater\nPlease note: The purchase amount that requires Procurement Services to validate competitive selection for purchases of goods and services increased from $25,000 to $50,000 on May 6, 2024. Learn more. \nWhen purchasing a product or service with a cost of $50,000 or greater (after taxes and fees), the purchase requisition must include documentation verifying that the requirement for competition has been met. This documentation is reviewed by Procurement Services before school or unit financial approval. There are two documentation options available, which can be attached to the purchase requisition in iProcurement: \nIn addition to the quote from the selected supplier or independent contractor, attach at least one or more competitive quotes, proposals, or bids from other suppliers or independent contractors. If the lowest cost bid is not selected, the form below is used to explain the total value and demonstrate price reasonableness of the selected bid.\nOr\nWhen multiple quotes were not solicited, attach a completed single or sole source justification form. \nA single source is a supplier or independent contractor specifically selected amongst others due to superior value, such as compatibility, quality, service, support, continuity, etc.\nA sole source is a supplier or independent contractor for which there are no alternatives for their given product or service, or there are other factors.\nThe source justification should include a statement that demonstrates the unique qualifications of the product or service, a description of efforts made to locate other sources (suppliers or independent contractors), and documentation that the anticipated cost is fair and reasonable.\nTo support continued compliance with the university\u2019s competitive supplier selection policy, schools and units can establish and/or maintain their own purchase amounts and process for the verification of competition for purchases below $50,000 and can attach the above documentation options to any purchase requisition, regardless of cost. \nProposal and Bidding Process\nA Request for Proposal (RFP) is a formal process used to gather proposals from suppliers or independent contractors to solve a problem or issue and considers a broad range of criteria, including price, quality, methodology, and service delivery plans (e.g., suppliers submit proposals, including cost estimates, to provide catering services at an event for 50 people). When requested by a university department, professional buyers in the Purchasing and Contracts department will assist with the RFP process.\nAn Invitation for Bid (IFB), which can be included in the RFP process, is generally used when the school or unit has a detailed, focused set of criteria (e.g., detailed design drawings and specifications) and the selection will be based mostly on the lowest bid received that meets such specifications. \nFor assistance with the preparation of an RFP, please submit a support request. Proposal or bid solicitations managed by the school or unit, without assistance from the Purchasing department, must comply with federal, state, and local regulations, as well as university policies that pertain to hiring contractors and consultants. \nTypically, department requestors consult directly with the supplier representative or independent contractor regarding development of a specific statement of work or assistance in developing project specifications and how the project needs would be delivered. \nA purchase order, contract, agreement, memorandum of understanding, letter of intent, or other document authorizing the project may only be executed by central Procurement with specifically delegated authority."}

{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/paying-people/paying-students-graduate-and-undergraduate", "text": "Paying Students (Graduate and Undergraduate)\nGraduate fellowships from Stanford-based funds generally are controlled by the school and administered by the university department. The department administrators determine the requirements and restrictions for fellowships, as well as the level of support given, ranging from funds to cover partial tuition to full tuition and a living stipend.\nProcessing Fellowship Support in GFS\nFellowship tuition and stipend payments are entered in the GFS by department personnel and are processed by the Student Financial Services Department. Fellowship tuition support is credited against tuition charges on the student\u2019s university bill. Stipends are not paid in cash, nor are they convertible to cash. The default for disbursement of stipends is \u201cstandard charges,\u201d i.e., after other university charges, such as room and board, have been deducted, the remaining fellowship stipend is paid as a refund check to the student. If students prefer to receive the fellowship check for the entire amount and pay the other charges with personal funds, the students must request their home department to issue the stipend as a \"check only - no deductions\" (use \"Stipend\" charge priority). Refer to the Graduate Financial Support Policy Manual for more information on Fellowships.\nCredit Balances\nCredit balances on student accounts may result from aid awards that exceed charges and/or aid awards intended to be disbursed entirely to the student (not for the payment of tuition or fee charges). Some student aid has restrictions placed on it by the donor or sponsor that preclude the aid from paying specific types of charges. Therefore, students may receive credit balance checks that include excess aid and/or stipend. Also, students who have unpaid charges on their account that aid is not eligible to pay, may receive a credit balance check from their student account. To prevent this, refer to the Financial Aid and Student Permissions section on the University Bill Payment Methods.\nRefund/Stipend Checks\nRefund/Stipend checks distributed from student accounts are sent via Direct Deposit. Students are strongly encouraged to use Direct Deposit, because it is the fastest way for students to receive their funds, and it ensures receipt of funds regardless of address changes.\nFor students who are not enrolled in Direct Deposit, live checks are mailed by the Student Financial Services Office directly to the mailing address on file in Axess. Live checks are mailed on the next business day after they are printed. \nStudents may review refund/stipend disbursement data in Axess by selecting View Refund Stipend Check the Finances drop-down menu in the Student tab.\nLeaves of Absence After Fellowships Are Paid\nIf students withdraw during a quarter, the department/school administrators determine whether a prorated amount of stipend must be repaid. To have the charges reduced, and thus be able to recapture any non-applicable tuition from the fellowship, students should file a request for a Leave of Absence as soon as they know it will be needed.\nExternal Fellowships Paid Directly to Students\nIn some cases, an external agency may award a fellowship directly to students, and the funding is not processed in any way through Stanford. In this case, the students are billed for tuition and fees in the same manner as other students, and they pay those expenses directly. The students\u2019 home department should enter this support in GFS as \u201cInfo Only\u201d to allow coordination of all aid the students may receive.\nGraduate students with a fellowship award paid directly to them may be eligible for a Cardinal Care health insurance subsidy. Entering an \u201cInfo Only\u201d aid line in GFS will trigger the subsidy, if appropriate.\nDepartment administrators should keep a copy of appropriate documentation defining such fellowship awards before making an \u201cInfo Only\u201d entry in GFS.\nSee the Graduate Financial Support Policy Manual for more information on Fellowships."}

These transactions must be managed to ensure they are posted to an account/fund (PTA) in a timely manner to comply with Stanford policy and federal regulations and to support financial stewardship of the university's resources. Stanford Financial Management Services (FMS) conducts a quarterly force clearing process to support the university in these efforts; view Policy: Clearing of Aging Transactions for details and the quarterly clearing schedule.\nThis overview describes the processing workflow of the main types of transactions which undergo the aging process and provides guidance and tools for managing aging and force cleared transactions. The types of transactions include:\nCredit card charges: Payments to suppliers using a Stanford issued Purchasing Card (PCard) or Travel Card (TCard).\nAdvances: Funds disbursed to a Stanford employee or student in advance of an expense being incurred, which are later reported in an expense request.\nReimbursement of personal funds: Requests for repayment of personal funds that were used to pay for university business and travel expenses, which are submitted via expense reports.\n60-day deadline and definitions of aging, outstanding, and cleared\nAging: An expense transaction begins aging on day one until it is submitted and approved locally (by its local school/unit). An aging transaction is considered overdue 60 days after a specific point that depends on the type of transaction: the credit card posted date for PCard expenses, the last day of travel/activity for TCard expenses, or the expected clearing date for advances. After this 60-day deadline, it is subject to force clearing by Stanford Financial Management Services (FMS).\nOutstanding: When expense transactions but have completed local school/unit approval but are pending approval and processing by FMS, the transactions stop aging but are considered \u201coutstanding\u201d in Oracle Business Intelligence (OBI) aging reports.\nCleared: An aging or outstanding transaction is considered fully cleared when it is paid and posted to an appropriate PTA.\nForce clearing of aging transactions\nIf a transaction has not been cleared within the 60-day timeline as described above, it may be included in the next quarterly force clearing cycle that FMS administers. Budget units will be charged $35 for each transaction that is force cleared, and repeated force clearings may result in individual card suspension. View Policy: Clearing of Aging Transactions for the quarterly force clearing schedule and Updated Card Suspension Process to Support Proper Use for details on individual card suspension and requesting reactivation reactivation.\nTax reporting of aging transactions\nPer IRS regulations, transactions that are not submitted within 60 days of being incurred may be reported as taxable income. Transactions need to reach \u201csubmitted\u201d status (or \u201cverified\u201d status for PCard) for local approval in Oracle Financials with all appropriate receipts or backup documentation within 60 days to comply with IRS regulations.\nPlease note that the timeline for how transactions are determined for force clearing may differ from the timeline that determines if the transaction needs to be tax reported. While a transaction will not be tax reported because it reached initial submission in time, it could still be force cleared if the remaining steps to completely clear the transaction take too long. Alternatively, a transaction may be tax reported because it took longer than 60 days to reach initial submission for local approval, but was not force cleared because the remaining steps of the transaction happened before the next force clearing deadline.\nLast Updated: Jul 7, 2024"}
{"url": "https://fingate.stanford.edu/managing-funds/managing-financial-risk", "text": "Managing Financial Risk\nInternal controls are the mechanisms, rules, policies, system configurations and procedures implemented to help ensure the accuracy and integrity of financial activities. Controls are implemented to provide reasonable assurance that goals and objectives are achieved; that the work of the university will continue and the mission is accomplished. An example of an internal control at Stanford is the concept of separation of duties, where no one individual is responsible for a complete financial process. \nInternal controls mitigate risk by promoting accountability, protecting data and helping to prevent fraud. Controls protect not only Stanford, but its employees. Properly functioning internal controls can protect an employee from being accused of a misdeed or prevent an error from occurring. Internal controls help to focus our attention on the critical work of the university, rather than recovery from unexpected events or errors.\nTypes of Internal Controls\nAn effective internal control environment incorporates interrelated types of controls that are designed and implemented to mitigate risks based on where and when they occur. Some of the types of controls are illustrated in the table below. \nCategory Type of Control Description and Example \nFundamental types of controls \tMitigating\tMitigating controls attempt to discover mistakes and permanently reduce the possibility of occurrence. This may include a review of final activity and financial reports for discrepancies between planned and actual activities or regular comparison of budget to actual during the close process.\t\n\tCompensating\tCompensating controls are implemented when compliance cannot be met with existing controls or to offset the absence of a key control. Separation of duties is a compensating control that helps safeguard University resources by separating responsibility for a task. For example, separation of duties between individuals responsible for ordering processes and those responsible for account reconciliations can ensure that potential errors are detected. \t\nControls based on the point in the process when the risk occurs\tPreventative\tPreventative controls stop something from happening before it occurs. The pre-approval of a purchase requisition before a purchase is made is an example of a preventive control. \t\n\tDetective\tDetective controls occur after an activity has already happened so that actions can be taken to reduce the risk or correct the error within a reasonable timeframe. The verification and approval of a PCard transaction is a detective control, as is regular review of expenditures against budget.\t\n\tCorrective\tCorrective controls are usually implemented after a detective control discovers a problem which requires remediation. Examples include filing incident reports and developing or updating policies to address why the problem occurred. \t\nControls based on manner of implementation\tAutomated\tAutomated controls are built into a system and are carried out exactly the same way every time. These controls may still need a person to review them and take any appropriate action. For example, when a capital equipment requisition is entered, an \u2018end route\u2019 approver is added to apply necessary expertise to this unique and high risk type of purchasing activity. \t\n\tManual\tManual controls are performed by an individual and must be done consistently to maintain effectiveness. For example, manual sampling of random financial transactions on a quarterly basis.\t\nControls based on cadence and occurrence\tRoutine\tRoutine controls are always in place for each financial activity. For example, the requirement for a designated PTA approver to review and approve every transaction that meets a specific threshold.\t\n\tPeriodic\tPeriodic controls are performed on a regular cadence. For example, a weekly review of activity, a monthly reconciliation of an expenditure report, or an annual comparison of budget versus actual.\t\nThere is not one type of control that mitigates all risks. The type of control or combination of controls implemented must support the specific intended risk mitigation. To avoid some risks, a preventive control may be required, whereas for others, a detective control may be more appropriate, and in some cases, a combination of controls is the best approach.\nControl and Mitigation Activities\nThere is a range of activities that are implemented within a control environment to support ongoing financial risk management. Below are a few key activities within the university\u2019s financial ecosystem.\nSeparation of Duties\nSeparation of duties is a specific type of control and mitigation activity where more than one person is required to complete a single task, ensuring that no one individual has sole oversight over the full transaction. Duties are separated, as a preventative control, among different individuals to reduce the risk of error or inappropriate action. Normally, responsibilities for authorizing transactions (approval), maintaining custody of assets (receiving), recording transactions (accounting) and handling the related asset are divided. \nFor example, the same person should not authorize a transaction for goods, approve the request, receive the goods ordered, record the transaction (such as authorizing the invoice for payment or deciding the PTA to charge the goods) and reconcile it (ensuring cost is reasonable, appropriate and charged to the correct PTA). \nClearly designed, assigned and documented separation of duties allows for operational management to occur with those most familiar with a business transaction, but in a controlled manner that allows for issues to be quickly identified and resolved. Separation of duties should be a key consideration when delegating financial approval authority in a unit. \nTransaction and System Controls\nSystem controls are systematic mechanisms implemented to mitigate the risk of error, fraud, waste and abuse. System controls are built into an application, such as Oracle Financials, and carried out exactly the same way every time, leading to automation. These controls may still need a person to review them and take appropriate action. Transaction and system controls continue to evolve to ensure that knowledgeable staff can originate, approve and review a transaction within an established structure that supports compliance and financial reporting. \nReconciliation\nReconciliation, which is another type of control activity, is the process of comparing transactions and activity to supporting documentation for validation. It ensures that two complete sets of related data match and are in agreement. Reconciliations provide an after-the-fact review; a detective control to identify anomalies when reviewing aggregated data. Having an internal structure for expenditure type usage and budget rolls-ups creates efficiencies in this review. For schools and departments that use conventions around expenditure types and budget rollups, there is the ability to capture anomalies across large budget segments. \nReconciliations of financial information should be performed with a critical mindset, which includes asking oneself important questions such as:\nWas the expenditure allocable to the right PTA? \nDo the charges from other units or service centers represent services that were requested and received?\nIs the travel or equipment charges accurate, not duplicated and related to the project? \nWas the correct expenditure type used and was it reviewed to ensure accuracy?\nWere any costs allocated to more than one PTA shared equitably, and the allocation documented per policy guidance? \nAre all expected costs posted and if not, have they been investigated? \nAre open items or variances resolved in a timely manner?\nLearn more about one type of reconciliation at Stanford on the Topic Overview: Balance Sheet Account Balance Reconciliation.\nTraining\nTraining, which is another type of control activity, helps ensure that staff are able to understand and gain practice with the various types of transactions and how to understand the \u201cwhy\u201d behind them, mechanics of processes and systems and their supporting policies. This, in turn, allows them to focus on the critical components of their work, doing what they do best and escalating concerns as needed. Training may occur through courses, practical exercises and ongoing assessment and feedback cycles. Examples of training and resources related to financial risk management are available under \u2018Resources and Training.\u2019\nEstablishing Controls\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that controls are not always perfectly effective and must be implemented alongside other measures to reduce and mitigate risk. With any control or risk management strategy comes a cost to the organization, whether through resources such as costs for training or technology, increased administration and/or business delays. Striking the balance between the right degree of controls that mitigate risk but do not overly hinder the organization\u2019s goals is an ongoing, evolving process.\nTo establish internal controls, management collaborates with their team to consider the risks to the team\u2019s goals, and sets procedures in place to reduce the risks. Management should evaluate the likelihood and frequency of the risk, the cost of the risk, the cost of the control procedure, and make decisions on the control design, including the level of risk the organization can accept and the impact the risk may have to its objectives."}
